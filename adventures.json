Three bogus consignments have passed Consortium inspection in the past month, and Valdric can't go to the authorities without exposing himself to his rivals. He needs outsiders\"”people with no guild allegiance and the good sense to be discreet.\n\nThe trail leads from counting houses to a forger's workshop above a tannery, and from there to a middleman who knows far more about what's moving through Mottgorte's docks than anyone should be comfortable with. Along the way, the heroes will learn their first hard lesson about Ammaria: everyone's guilty of something, and the truth is just another commodity.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n*For the Game Master's eyes only.*\n\nThe forgeries are the work of Morvek, a skilled seal-cutter operating from a concealed workshop on Tanner's Row. Morvek was commissioned by a middleman called Three-Finger Ash, who in turn works for Merchant-Factor Corwynn of Aldmoor. The shipments cleared under Valdric's stolen identity contained weapons components\"”crossbow mechanisms and unfinished blades\"”bound eastward toward Thornvale.\n\nWhether Corwynn is arming resistance fighters, supplying bandits, or running a private arsenal is beyond the scope of this adventure. The heroes are hired to find the forger and stop the counterfeiting. Everything else is foreshadowing.\n\nThe Consortium inspector who cleared the shipments, Brennan Cole, was bribed. He's been spending well beyond a clerk's salary, and he's terrified someone will notice.\n\n## GETTING THE HEROES INVOLVED\n\n**The Discreet Commission.** Valdric Thornwood approaches the heroes through an intermediary at a guild coffee house. He offers fifty crowns upfront and a hundred and fifty on resolution. He's precise, nervous, and speaks entirely in commercial metaphors. \"My brand has been diluted. I need the source of contamination identified and cauterised.\"\n\n**Guild Business.** A factor the heroes have worked with before mentions that Valdric is looking for \"quiet hands.\" There's good coin in it, and Valdric remembers people who help him. In Mottgorte, a grateful merchant is worth more than gold.\n\n**The Wrong Place.** The heroes witness a dockside argument between two merchants over a shipment both claim to have authorised under the same seal. One of them is Valdric, and his face has gone the colour of old parchment. He'll approach the heroes afterward, desperate and willing to pay whatever it takes.\n\n---\n\n## THE SITUATION\n\n### Part One: The Merchant's Problem\n\n*Dark timber and leaded glass, three storeys high. The kind of building that announces its owner has money but would prefer you didn't look too closely at how he got it. Door locked. Curtains drawn. Voice barely above a whisper.*\n\nValdric receives the heroes in his private office. Three shipments have been cleared under his seal in the past month\"”general goods from Aldmoor, according to the manifests. He never authorised any of them. His seal is a signet ring that never leaves his finger, which means someone copied it from an impression on an existing document. That narrows the field to anyone who's handled his authenticated paperwork in the last year\"”which, unfortunately, is quite a lot of people.\n\nWhat Valdric does know is that the Consortium inspector who waved the shipments through was a clerk named Brennan Cole. And Cole has recently been seen drinking in establishments well above his pay grade.\n\n**Investigation Paths.** The heroes have three solid leads, and clever players may find others:\n\n*Inspector Cole.* He can be found at the Harbormaster's office during working hours or at the Gilt Lantern tavern most evenings. He's a small man living large on borrowed time. Intimidation cracks him quickly\"”he'll admit to taking bribes and point the heroes toward Tanner's Row. A hundred crowns buys the same information without the bruises. Subtler heroes can simply follow him and watch where he goes after dark. He visits the workshop twice a week.\n\n*The Seal Registry.* The Consortium maintains records of every authenticated seal impression. Accessing these requires either the Guild Journeyman Edge, a fifty-crown bribe to the records clerk, or a Persuasion roll. Success reveals that the forged seals use a different ink composition than Valdric's originals\"”Aldmoor mineral content in the wax, not Mottgorte. Someone local is doing the work, but the materials came from elsewhere.\n\n*Tanner's Row.* Whether the heroes follow Cole, trace the ink, or simply start asking questions in the right taverns, the trail converges on the upper floor of Morvek's Tannery in the Dyers' Quarter.\n\n> **Appraiser Edge Spotlight.** If any hero has the Appraiser Edge, examining Valdric's documents is the moment it shines. The +2 to Notice for detecting forgery turns what might be a blind investigation into an immediate breakthrough: different mineral content in the wax, copied from an impression rather than the original ring, Aldmoor provenance. \"Your seal was duplicated from a document, not your signet. Someone who handles your paperwork sold you out.\"\n\n### Part Two: The Workshop on Tanner's Row\n\n*The reek hits before the building does\"”urine, lime, and something sharper underneath. A narrow building on Stink Row, wedged between a dye-works and a chandler's, with one shuttered window on the upper floor glowing faintly orange.*\n\nThe ground floor is a legitimate tanning operation\"”hides, vats, chemicals. The upper floor is something else entirely: a cramped workshop reeking of hot wax, solvent, and the sharp metallic tang of engraving tools. One shuttered window, one door, two workbenches cluttered with seal-making equipment, a brazier for heating wax, and shelves lined with sample documents bearing the seals of half the merchants in Mottgorte.\n\n**The Occupants.** Morvek the forger works here most nights alongside two apprentices. A single sentry\"”bored, underpaid, not expecting trouble\"”watches the rear stairs from the alley. On any given evening, all four are present.\n\n**Approaches.** Heroes have options:\n\n*Stealth.* The rear stairs are accessible from the alley behind the chandler's shop. Beating the sentry's Notice gets the heroes to the workshop door unannounced. From there, they can observe, eavesdrop, or burst in with surprise.\n\n*Social.* Posing as customers requires a plausible cover story and a Persuasion roll against the sentry. \"We need documentation for a shipment, and we were told Morvek handles special requests\" gets the heroes through the door without weapons drawn. What happens next depends on how long the deception holds.\n\n*Direct.* Kicking in the front door alerts everyone inside. The sentry draws his hand crossbow. Morvek bolts for the window. The apprentices grab whatever's hot and sharp.\n\n---\n\n> **ENCOUNTER: THE WORKSHOP**\n>\n> **Terrain:** Cramped Interior, Dim Lighting (âˆ’2 beyond 5\")  \n> **Opponents:** Morvek (Wild Card, flees toward window), 2 Apprentices (grab hot irons), 1 Sentry (blocks door)  \n> **Hazards:** Alchemist's fire on shelf near door (called shot TN 4 to ignite, 2d6 fire zone, spreads 1\"/round); brazier (Agility or 2d6 fire if pushed into it). Maximum two combatants can engage same target due to cramped space.  \n> **Duration:** 3\"“4 rounds. Morvek surrenders if Wounded. Apprentices break if he does.  \n> **Bennies:** Morvek burns his 1 benny on an Agility roll to escape through the window\"”he's a craftsman, not a fighter. Don't waste it on combat.\n\n---\n\nMorvek is a craftsman, not a fighter. His first action is to flee toward the window, which requires breaking the shutters (Strength versus a target of 4). If blocked, he surrenders immediately. He's arrogant about his work but a coward when it comes to violence, and he'll bargain with information the moment steel comes out.\n\nThe apprentices are young and scared. They grab hot branding irons from the brazier and fight with the desperate energy of people who see no other option. If Morvek surrenders, they break\"”dropping weapons and begging for mercy.\n\nThe sentry, if he hasn't been dealt with already, blocks the door and fights with a club in one hand and a hand crossbow in the other. He's competent but not committed. One Wound sends him running.\n\n**What Morvek Reveals.** Whether captured, intimidated, or simply offered enough coin, Morvek talks. He was commissioned by a middleman called Three-Finger Ash, who operates from the Rusty Anchor tavern in Dockmaw. Payment came in Aldmoor-minted coin. The goods cleared under forged seals were bound for \"somewhere east\"\"”Morvek didn't ask, because in his line of work, asking questions is bad for your health.\n\n**Victory Conditions.** Capturing Morvek alive earns the heroes the full two hundred crowns from Valdric, plus the forger's client list\"”a document of considerable value to anyone who trades in secrets. Killing him reduces the payout to fifty crowns (Valdric wanted answers, not a corpse), though the client list can still be found in the workshop. If the workshop burns, the evidence goes up with it, and the neighbouring buildings are at risk\"”a moral complication that tests whether the heroes care about collateral damage.\n\n### Part Three: The Middleman\n\n*Low ceilings, cheap ale, and the kind of silence that falls when strangers walk in. The Rusty Anchor sits on a Dockmaw wharf, and half the patrons are conducting business they'd rather not discuss in daylight.*\n\nThree-Finger Ash earned his name the obvious way and doesn't appreciate being reminded of it. He's a fixture at the Rusty Anchor in Dockmaw\"”paranoid but greedy, two qualities that make him predictable. He'll sell out his employer for a hundred crowns or a guaranteed promise of protection. He can also be intimidated, but his Spirit is d8 and he's been threatened by professionals; heroes had better bring their best.\n\n**What Ash Knows.** His employer is Merchant-Factor Corwynn, based in Aldmoor. The shipments contained weapons components\"”crossbow mechanisms and unfinished blades, disassembled and packed as \"general hardware.\" The destination was \"Thornvale way,\" though Ash doesn't know the final recipient. Corwynn has connections in Grimhollow, which should make anyone who knows Ammarian politics slightly nervous.\n\n**Resolution.** The heroes have earned their pay. They can report everything to Valdric, who'll be grateful, horrified, and suddenly far more careful about who handles his documents. They can investigate Corwynn independently\"”an avenue that leads well beyond Mottgorte and into the kind of conspiracy that ends careers or starts them. They can sell the information to interested parties: the Consortium would pay well for evidence of smuggling, the Brotherhood of the Fallen Star would pay better for leverage over a merchant-factor, and darker powers might pay most of all for knowledge of an arms pipeline.\n\nWhat the heroes choose to do with what they've learned matters more than what they've found.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT IF...\n\n*The heroes go straight to Tanner's Row?* They can. The sentry is still there, Morvek is still working. They miss the Cole subplot entirely, which is fine\"”Cole's bribery is flavour, not essential. Adjust Valdric's debrief accordingly.\n\n*The workshop burns down?* Evidence destroyed. Neighbouring buildings at risk. If the heroes help fight the fire, they earn goodwill in the Dyers' Quarter. If they don't, they earn a reputation for collateral damage. Ash's trail goes cold unless the heroes already know about Tanner's Row from another source\"”suggest the Seal Registry if they haven't tried it.\n\n*They kill Morvek?* Fifty crowns from Valdric instead of two hundred. The client list survives in the workshop if they search (Notice, no penalty). The adventure works but loses its best information source.\n\n*They go to the Watch?* The Watch is interested, after a fashion. An officer takes their statement and promises to investigate, which means the report sits on a desk for three weeks while Morvek packs up and vanishes. Valdric warned them: official channels are slow, leaky, and full of people who owe favours to his rivals.\n\n---\n\n## SKILL CHECK REFERENCE\n\n| Check | Target | Context |\n|:------|:------:|:--------|\n| Intimidation vs Spirit d6 | 6+ | Crack Inspector Cole |\n| Persuasion | 6 | Access Seal Registry |\n| Stealth vs Notice d6 | 6+ | Follow Cole unseen |\n| Streetwise | 4 | Hear about Tanner's Row |\n| Common Knowledge | 6 (âˆ’2) | Same result, harder |\n| Notice (Appraiser +2) | 4 | Detect forgery details |\n| Stealth vs Notice d6 | 6+ | Approach rear stairs unseen |\n| Persuasion vs Smarts d6 | 6+ | Bluff past sentry |\n| Strength | 4 | Break window shutters |\n| Shooting (called shot) | 4 | Ignite alchemist's fire |\n| Agility | 4 | Avoid brazier hazard |\n| Intimidation vs Spirit d8 | 8+ | Pressure Three-Finger Ash |\n| Persuasion vs Smarts d6 | 6+ | Bribe or convince Ash |\n\n---\n\n## KEY NPCS\n\n### Valdric Thornwood \"” Merchant (Wild Card)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d6, Smarts d8, Spirit d6, Strength d6, Vigor d6  \n**Skills:** Common Knowledge (Commerce) d10, Gambling d6, Notice d8, Persuasion d8  \n**Pace:** 6; **Parry:** 4; **Toughness:** 5  \n**Gear:** Fine clothes, authentic Guild Seal, 200â‚¡  \n**Special:** Nervous, precise, and deeply aware that his reputation is the only thing standing between him and ruin.\n\n### Morvek \"” Forger (Wild Card)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d6, Smarts d10, Spirit d6, Strength d6, Vigor d6  \n**Skills:** Fighting d4, Forgery d10, Notice d8, Stealth d6, Thievery d8  \n**Pace:** 6; **Parry:** 4; **Toughness:** 5  \n**Bennies:** 1 (burns it fleeing, not fighting)  \n**Gear:** Guild knife (Str+d4), three finished forgeries, master seal templates  \n**Special:** Surrenders if Wounded.

Valdric becomes a reliable contact for commercial information. Morvek, if alive, becomes a reluctant informant for future investigations. Three-Finger Ash remembers the heroes, for better or worse.\n\n**Partial Success:** Fifty crowns if Morvek is dead. Trail goes cold if the workshop burns. Valdric is disappointed but pays for effort. The counterfeiting stops, but the arms pipeline continues undetected.\n\n**Consequences:** The Thornvale weapons shipment isn't just a plot thread\"”it's a signal that someone is arming people outside Mottgorte's established power structures. Whether that's resistance, rebellion, or something worse remains to be seen. Heroes who dig deeper will find that Corwynn's name surfaces again, much later, in contexts that make tonight's little forgery ring look quaint.\n\n---\n\n## SCALING\n\n**Seasoned.** Add two more sentries to the tannery\"”one watching the street, one inside the ground floor. Upgrade Morvek's escape plan: he has a *bolt* scroll (2d6 damage) he'll use to cover his retreat rather than simply running. Three-Finger Ash has a bodyguard (use Skilled Extra stats: Fighting d8, Notice d6; Parry 6; Toughness 7(1); shortsword, leather armour).\n\n**Veteran.** Inspector Cole has been murdered before the heroes reach him\"”someone is cleaning house, and the investigation becomes a race against a professional fixer. The workshop has a magical ward on the door (Notice at âˆ’2 to detect; triggers *stun* if forced, Vigor roll or Shaken). Ash won't meet in public; the heroes must locate his safehouse in Dockmaw, adding an additional infiltration scene.\n\n---\n\n## FORESHADOWING\n\nThis adventure plants seeds for future content. Don't explain them\"”just let them land:\n\n**The Thornvale Shipment.** Weapons components moving east toward Thornvale. This thread surfaces again in Week 41, when the heroes learn what\"”or who\"”those weapons were meant for.\n\n**The Grimhollow Connection.** Corwynn's ties to Grimhollow hint at a larger network operating between Ammaria's merchant cities. This pays off in Phase 7.\n\n**Grandmother Holst's Booth.** If the heroes visit the Counting Quarter markets, they may notice an empty booth that local traders avoid. \"Grandmother Holst hasn't been in all week. Nobody's asking why.\" This thread pays off in Week 3.\n\n**The Scarred Man.** At some point during the investigation\"”in a tavern, on a street corner, watching from across the canal\"”the heroes spot a heavyset man with a distinctive scar running from ear to jaw. He's watching them. If approached, he vanishes into the crowd with practised ease. Scarface Tomas surfaces properly in Week 4.\n\n---\n\n## DESIGNER NOTES\n\n*The Counterfeit Seal* is designed as a first adventure for a new Ammarian campaign. It introduces heroes to Mottgorte's guild politics, teaches them that investigation and social skills matter as much as fighting, and demonstrates the moral texture of life in the merchant cities. Nobody here is innocent\"”not Valdric, who almost certainly has his own skeletons; not Morvek, whose talent is employed by anyone willing to pay; and not the heroes themselves, if they choose to sell what they've learned to the highest bidder.\n\nThe combat encounter in the workshop is deliberately constrained. The cramped space, the fire hazards, and Morvek's willingness to surrender all serve the same purpose: this fight should be fast, dangerous, and over quickly. Three to four rounds at most. If it runs longer than that, something's gone wrong.\n\nThe adventure showcases Investigation and Social systems as its primary Savage Worlds mechanics, with a combat encounter that emphasises environmental complications and pre-applied conditions. The Appraiser Edge gets an explicit spotlight, and the investigation rewards Notice, Research, Persuasion, Intimidation, Streetwise, and Thievery\"”ensuring that multiple character builds have meaningful contributions.\n\n---\n\n*This adventure requires the Savage Worlds core rules.*  \n*Recommended: Ammaria: Land of the Merchant Guilds regional supplement.*\n\n*Product Code: DFS-AM-A001-SEAL*  \n*Â© 2026 DiceForge Studios Ltd.

Four in two weeks, and the City Watch blames ratlings from the old warrens beneath the canal district. The families don't believe it\"”ratlings haven't caused trouble in months\"”but nobody with authority cares enough to investigate. The heroes are hired by a washerwoman who has spent her life savings on one desperate hope: that someone will go down into the dark and bring her son home.\n\nThe sewers beneath Mottgorte are flooded, pitch-black, and home to something far worse than ratlings. A sewer wyrm has claimed the junction tunnels as hunting ground, and it doesn't distinguish between rats and children.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n*For the Game Master's eyes only.*\n\nA mature sewer wyrm migrated upward from the deep warrens three weeks ago, driven from its territory by something even it fears. It has established a new hunting ground in the junction tunnels beneath Dockside, where the warmth from above attracts prey. The wyrm hunts by vibration\"”it is completely blind but can detect movement through water and stone with terrifying precision.\n\nThe missing children were taken near a drain grate where Dockside youngsters play. Two are dead. Two\"”including Tam, the washerwoman's son\"”are alive, clinging to a stone platform in the wyrm's lair, too cold and frightened to move. The wyrm hasn't killed them because they've been still. Movement is death.\n\nThe ratlings sealed their own warrens against the wyrm weeks ago. They've lost scouts too, and they're frightened. If the heroes make contact, the ratlings become unlikely allies with knowledge of the tunnels that could save lives.\n\n## GETTING THE HEROES INVOLVED\n\n**The Mother's Plea.** Mistress Corvenna finds the heroes at their lodgings, their tavern, or wherever they've been spending time in Mottgorte. She's a washerwoman\"”worn hands, worn clothes, worn patience. She offers twenty crowns, which is everything she has. \"I know it's not enough. I know you could just walk away. Please.\" Heroes who refuse this deserve whatever game they're playing instead.\n\n**Ratling Whispers.** If the heroes have contacts in Mottgorte's underworld, word reaches them that something has changed below the streets. The ratlings have sealed their warrens\"”unprecedented\"”and dock workers are refusing night shifts near the old grates. Something is hunting down there, and it's not ratlings.\n\n**Witness.** A hero with the Alertness Edge or a Notice of d8 or better spots drag marks near the old drain grate while passing through Dockside. Something large pulled something small underground here. Recently.\n\n---\n\n## THE SITUATION\n\n### Part One: The Missing\n\n*Grey water, grey buildings, grey faces. Dockside is where Mottgorte puts the people it would rather not think about. The canal runs sluggish here, scummed with tannery runoff, and the buildings lean against each other like they've given up standing straight.*\n\nDockside is Mottgorte's cheapest district. Four children have vanished in two weeks. Watch Sergeant Brennan filed reports blaming ratling abduction and went back to his card game. The families have been told to grieve quietly.\n\nMistress Corvenna's son Tam disappeared three days ago. She can describe where the children played\"”near an old drain grate behind the chandler's warehouse\"”and she knows the Watch has done nothing. \"Dockside children don't matter to them.\" She's right, and she knows it, and she's asking anyway.\n\n**Investigation.** Three leads, each pointing the same direction: down.\n\n*The Drain Grate.* Large enough for a child, recently disturbed. Scratch marks on the stone\"”something with claws gripped the edge. Drag marks lead down into darkness. A hero who stays quiet and watches catches a flicker of movement in the black below. Something is watching from the water.\n\n*Ratling Contact.* If any hero has established ratling connections, the warrens offer confirmation. \"Something else hunts down there. We've lost scouts too. The old tunnels are sealed, but it moves through places we cannot reach.\" The ratlings are afraid. That should terrify everyone.\n\n*The Survivor.* One child, a girl named Bess, escaped. She's hiding in the crawlspace beneath a dockside warehouse, traumatised and barely coherent. Persuasion or genuinely creative roleplay draws her story out in fragments: \"Long and wet. Eyes that don't see. It came through the water and the water didn't move until it was too close.\"\n\n### Part Two: The Descent\n\n*The drain grate opens onto darkness so thick it feels solid. The smell rises in waves\"”stagnant water, rotting stone, and something organic and wrong underneath it all. Cold air moves against your skin. Something down here is breathing.*\n\nThe sewers beneath Mottgorte were built by people who understood engineering and feared floods. Three centuries later, nobody maintains them, the water table has risen, and the tunnels serve as a combined drainage system, smuggling route, and graveyard for things the surface would rather forget.\n\n**Navigation.** Survival keeps the heroes on track. Failure adds an extra ten to sixty minutes of wandering (1d6 × 10) and one additional random encounter. Heroes with ratling guides bypass this entirely.\n\n**The Environment.** These conditions apply throughout the sewers. Read them, internalise them, and apply them consistently\"”they're the real antagonist of the first half of this adventure.\n\nThe tunnels are pitch dark. Without a light source, every visual action suffers a âˆ’6 penalty. Torches and lanterns work but announce the heroes' presence to anything hunting by vibration\"”and the wyrm hunts by vibration.\n\nWater ranges from waist-deep in the main passages (difficult terrain, half Pace; anyone struck or shoved must make Athletics or go under) to chest-deep in the connecting tunnels (swimming required; attacks at âˆ’2). Heroes wearing armour suffer an additional âˆ’2 to Athletics per point of armour bonus when swimming. The water is filthy, cold, and full of things nobody wants to think about.\n\nEchoes carry strangely. Notice rolls to detect movement gain +2, but Stealth rolls suffer âˆ’2. Sound bounces. The wyrm knows this. The heroes will learn.\n\n**Random Encounters.** If the heroes take a wrong turn or spend too long in one place, roll a d6:\n\nOn a 1\"“2, a dock rat swarm boils out of a side tunnel, driven from its usual territory by the wyrm. Desperate and aggressive, the swarm is immune to normal weapons\"”only area effects harm it. On a 3\"“4, a ratling patrol emerges from behind a sealed grate, crossbows levelled, terrified but willing to talk if the heroes show peaceful intent. On a 5, a section of tunnel collapses\"”Agility roll or take d6 damage from falling stone. On a 6, the wyrm itself passes through an adjacent tunnel. The heroes hear displaced water. Something massive just moved past them in the dark.\n\n### Part Three: The Junction\n\n*The tunnel opens into a domed chamber where four passages converge. Chest-deep water, black as ink. A raised stone platform in the centre\"”the only dry ground. Two small shapes huddle there, perfectly still. They've learned what movement costs.*\n\nThe sewer junction is a circular chamber where four major tunnels converge around a central platform of raised stone\"”an engineering access point, now the only dry ground in thirty yards. Two children huddle on the platform. They haven't moved in hours. They know, with the animal instinct of the very young and the very frightened, that movement means death.\n\nThe wyrm is here. It circles the junction in the flooded tunnels, a twelve-foot serpentine body gliding through black water without ripple or sound. It detects prey through vibration. Stillness is invisibility. Movement is a dinner bell.\n\n---\n\n> **ENCOUNTER: DOCK RAT SWARM**\n>\n> **Terrain:** Flooded tunnel, waist-deep water (difficult terrain)  \n> **Opponent:** Dock Rat Swarm \"” Parry 8 (6 base +2 Swarm), Toughness 7. Immune to normal weapons. Auto 2d4 damage to everyone in its space. Only area effects harm it.  \n> **Hazard:** Filth Fever \"” any hero Wounded by swarm makes Vigor or contracts disease (onset 24hrs, one Fatigue/day until cured by Healing or medicine)  \n> **Duration:** 2\"“3 rounds. Deal with it fast\"”the noise attracts the wyrm.  \n> **Bennies:** None (Extras). Spend yours wisely; the main event follows.\n\n---\n\n> **ENCOUNTER: THE SEWER WYRM**\n>\n> **Terrain:** Junction chamber, chest-deep water (swimming, attacks at âˆ’2), pitch dark (âˆ’6 without light). Raised stone platform (dry, 3\" across).  \n> **Opponent:** Sewer Wyrm (Wild Card). Drops from ceiling Round 1, targets isolated character. Constricts on raise. Drags victim toward deep water Rounds 2\"“3. Retreats into drain pipes at 1 Wound (returns in 1d6 rounds from different direction). Flees at 2 Wounds.  \n> **Tactical Puzzle:** Wyrm detects vibration, not sight. Standing still = Spirit roll vs Notice d10 = invisible. Heroes must move to rescue children but movement draws the wyrm. Light sources don't matter mechanically but dousing them helps psychologically.  \n> **Duration:** 4\"“6 rounds (or less if heroes exploit the stillness mechanic)  \n> **Bennies:** Wyrm has 2. Uses first to Soak. Uses second on Notice to detect a \"hidden\" hero at worst possible moment.\n\n---\n\nDeal with the swarm fast. The noise attracts the wyrm.\n\n**The Sewer Wyrm.** This is the main event, and it should feel like one.\n\nThe wyrm fights smart. Round one: it drops from the ceiling onto an isolated character, striking from above where nobody's looking. If it hits with a raise, Constrict triggers\"”the target is Entangled and takes Strength damage every round until freed. Round two and three: it drags its victim toward deeper water while its coils tighten. Other attacks are distractions; the wyrm focuses on one meal at a time. If it takes a Wound, it retreats into the drain pipes, vanishing for 1d6 rounds before returning from a different direction. Two Wounds send it fleeing permanently into the deep tunnels.\n\n**The Stillness Counter.** Clever heroes can exploit the wyrm's Blindsight limitation. It detects *vibration*, not sight. Standing perfectly still in the water\"”a Spirit roll versus the wyrm's Notice of d10\"”renders a character effectively invisible. Dousing light sources helps psychologically but isn't mechanically necessary; the wyrm can't see the light anyway. This creates a magnificent tactical puzzle: the heroes need to move to rescue the children, but movement is what makes them prey.\n\n**Victory Conditions.** Killing the wyrm resolves the threat permanently. Driving it off (two Wounds) is a temporary solution\"”it will return in weeks, and someone will have to deal with it eventually. Rescuing the children is the primary objective; success even if the wyrm escapes. Two children are alive on the platform. Two are not. Tam is alive. What the heroes tell Mistress Corvenna about the other families is their burden to carry.\n\n### The Moral Dimension\n\n**The Ratling Alliance.** If the heroes made ratling contact during Part One, an elder named Skritch offers an alternative: seal the deep tunnels together. Human engineering knowledge plus ratling knowledge of the warren layout could trap the wyrm in the lower passages permanently, protecting both communities. This requires cooperation, trust, and the willingness to let the wyrm live\"”just somewhere else.\n\n*Seal the tunnels:* Dramatic Task, 5 successes, using Athletics, Repair, and Survival. Success protects everyone, earns a ratling alliance worth its weight in future favours, and leaves the wyrm alive but contained.\n\n*Hunt the wyrm:* Permanent solution, no alliance, ratlings remain neutral toward the heroes.\n\n*Ignore the ratlings:* Miss the opportunity entirely. The ratlings remember.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT IF...\n\n*The heroes bring fire into the sewers?* Torches work. Lanterns work better. Both announce the heroes to the wyrm via vibration from the flame's heat distortion on the water\"”but the wyrm hunts by vibration anyway, so the real cost is psychological, not tactical. Let the players debate it.\n\n*They refuse to go underground?* The children die. Corvenna's grief is devastating. The wyrm continues hunting. If the heroes try an alternative approach\"”flooding, smoking it out, poisoning the water\"”reward creativity but make clear it risks killing the surviving children.\n\n*The wyrm flees and they can't find it?* It returns in weeks. The adventure succeeds if the children are rescued. The wyrm's survival is a loose thread, not a failure\"”it creates future content.\n\n*They attack the ratlings?* Combat is brief and one-sided (the ratlings flee into tunnels too small for humans). The alliance is permanently lost. Navigation becomes much harder without guides. Adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## SKILL CHECK REFERENCE\n\n| Check | Target | Context |\n|:------|:------:|:--------|\n| Notice d8+ or Alertness | Auto | Spot drag marks (Witness hook) |\n| Stealth vs Notice d8 | 8+ | Watch the drain grate unseen |\n| Streetwise | 6 (âˆ’2) | Establish ratling contact |\n| Persuasion vs Spirit d8 | 8+ | Draw Bess's story out |\n| Survival | 6 | Navigate the sewers |\n| Notice (+2 from echoes) | Varies | Detect movement underground |\n| Stealth (âˆ’2 from echoes) | Varies | Move quietly underground |\n| Athletics | 4 | Avoid going under when struck in water |\n| Athletics (âˆ’2 per armour pt) | 4 | Swim in chest-deep sections |\n| Agility | 4 | Avoid falling stone (collapse) |\n| Spirit vs Notice d10 | 10+ | Stand still to avoid wyrm detection |\n| Athletics/Repair/Survival | 4 | Dramatic Task: seal tunnels (5 successes) |\n| Vigor | 4 | Resist Filth Fever from rat swarm |\n\n---\n\n## KEY NPCS\n\n### Mistress Corvenna \"” Washerwoman (Civilian)\n\nNo combat stats. Will pay 20â‚¡ (her savings) for Tam's return or proof of his fate. Potential recurring questgiver for \"people's problems\" that the Watch won't touch.\n\n### Watch Sergeant Brennan \"” Corrupt Officer (Extra)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d4, Strength d8, Vigor d8  \n**Skills:** Fighting d6, Intimidation d8, Notice d4  \n**Pace:** 6; **Parry:** 5; **Toughness:** 8 (2)  \n**Gear:** Chain shirt (+2 Armour), shortsword (Str+d6)  \n**Special:** Dismissive of Dockside problems. Can be bribed, threatened, or simply ignored. Recurring obstacle.\n\n### Skritch \"” Ratling Elder (Wild Card)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d8, Strength d4, Vigor d6  \n**Skills:** Notice d10, Persuasion d6, Stealth d10, Survival d8  \n**Pace:** 6; **Parry:** 4; **Toughness:** 4 (Size âˆ’1)  \n**Bennies:** 2  \n**Edges:** Low Light Vision, Rat Affinity (commands normal rats within 10\")  \n**Special:** Speaks broken Common with careful precision. Old enough to remember when humans and ratlings traded openly. Wants peace but expects betrayal.\n\n### Sewer Wyrm (Wild Card)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d8, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d10, Vigor d10  \n**Skills:** Fighting d8, Notice d10, Stealth d10  \n**Pace:** 6 (Climb 6); **Parry:** 6; **Toughness:** 9 (2)  \n**Bennies:** 2  \n**Abilities:** Armour +2 (scaled hide), Bite (Str+d6, grip on raise), Blindsight (detects vibration; ignores darkness, invisibility), Constrict (on raise, Entangled, Strength damage/round), Wall Walker (full Pace on walls and ceilings)  \n**Tactics:** Drops from ceiling onto isolated target. Constricts and drags toward deep water. Retreats at 1 Wound, flees at 2.\n\n### Dock Rat Swarm (Extra)\n\n**Parry:** 8 (6 base +2 Swarm); **Toughness:** 7  \n**Abilities:** Swarm (immune to normal weapons, only area effects harm), Bite (auto 2d4 to all in space), Filth Fever (Vigor or disease on Wound)\n\n---\n\n## REWARDS & CONSEQUENCES\n\n**Success:** Twenty crowns from Corvenna\"”heroes who refuse the money gain something worth far more in Mottgorte. Ratling alliance (if earned) provides future access to the warrens, intelligence on underground movements, and the unsettling advantage of having a thousand small eyes watching the city's foundations. Filth Fever infection from the swarm drives heroes to the Keepers of the Sacred Flame\"”foreshadowing Week 5.\n\n**Failure:** The children die. Corvenna's grief becomes a weight the heroes carry. The wyrm remains. Dockside families learn that even paying for help gets them nothing.\n\n**Consequences:** Canal blockages revealed during the descent hint at smuggling routes through the sewers\"”a thread that pays off in Week 8. The ratling alliance, if established, changes the heroes' relationship with Mottgorte's underground permanently. And whatever drove the wyrm up from the deep warrens is still down there, in places even the ratlings won't go.\n\n---\n\n## SCALING\n\n**Seasoned.** Add a second, smaller wyrm (juvenile: reduce all attributes by one die type, Toughness 7(1), no Constrict). The rat swarm is larger\"”two swarms operating in adjacent tunnel sections. Ratling patrol is hostile rather than cautious, requiring Persuasion at âˆ’2 to avoid a fight.\n\n**Veteran.** The wyrm is fully mature: increase Strength and Vigor to d12, Toughness 11(2), and add Size +1. The deep tunnels contain evidence of what drove it upward\"”traces of Glasryan corruption that suggest something far worse lives beneath Mottgorte. Add an encounter with a corrupted ratling shaman who has been warped by exposure to whatever lurks below, previewing the Shadow of the Throne thread.\n\n---\n\n## FORESHADOWING\n\nThis adventure plants seeds for future content. Don't explain them\"”just let them land:\n\n**What Drove the Wyrm.** Something worse lives deeper. The ratlings won't discuss it. Skritch, if pressed, says only: \"The old places are wrong now. The stone sweats. The water tastes of metal and sadness.\" This thread extends into Phase 6.\n\n**Canal Blockages.** The heroes pass through tunnels partially blocked by crates and barrels\"”someone is using the sewer system to move cargo without customs inspection. The goods are long gone, but the infrastructure remains. This pays off in Week 8.\n\n**The Keepers' Healing.** If any hero contracts Filth Fever from the rat swarm, the most reliable cure in Dockside comes from the Keepers of the Sacred Flame\"”a minor temple near the canal markets. The acolyte who treats them, a young woman named Sera, asks pointed questions about what the heroes found underground. She's collecting information. For whom becomes clear in Week 5.\n\n---\n\n## DESIGNER NOTES\n\n*The Flooded Warren* shifts the campaign's register from investigation to survival horror. Where *The Counterfeit Seal* taught the heroes that Ammaria rewards brains over brawn, this adventure teaches them that sometimes the monster is real, the dark is absolute, and the only thing standing between innocent people and death is whether the heroes are willing to go into places sensible people avoid.\n\nThe sewer wyrm's Blindsight mechanic creates a tactical puzzle that rewards player creativity over character builds. The stillness counter\"”Spirit versus the wyrm's Notice\"”is the encounter's centrepiece, and it should create the kind of breathless, whispered-at-the-table tension that makes sessions memorable. Movement is death. Stillness is survival. But the children need someone to move.\n\nThe ratling alliance is the adventure's long-term investment. Players who take the time to negotiate rather than fight earn an asset that pays dividends across the entire Ammarian campaign. The choice between killing the wyrm (permanent solution, no alliance) and sealing the tunnels (cooperative solution, lasting relationship) is a test of whether the heroes think in terms of problems solved or relationships built.\n\n---\n\n*This adventure requires the Savage Worlds core rules.*  \n*Recommended: Ammaria: Land of the Merchant Guilds regional supplement.*\n\n*Product Code: DFS-AM-A002-WARR*  \n*Â© 2026 DiceForge Studios Ltd.

The Brotherhood of the Fallen Star seized his workshop a month ago and took his wife Elara and their two children three days past. They're being held in Holding House Three, a Brotherhood-run debtor's prison in the grey district the locals call the Debt Quarter. In three days, anyone who can't settle their account gets sold to the Slave Traders' Guild.\n\nGarrett has fifteen crowns and his grandfather's tools. He knows it's not enough. He's asking anyway.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n*For the Game Master's eyes only.*\n\nHolding House Three is a legitimate Brotherhood operation. The debt is real, the seizure was legal under Ammarian commercial law, and every Tallyman in the building is operating within the rules of a system designed to grind people into dust without breaking any laws. The Slave Traders' Guild auction is scheduled for three days hence, and the prices for a healthy woman and two children in Ammaria's market are depressingly well-established.\n\nThe house is run by a Tallyman called Voss\"”competent, confident, and accustomed to people coming to beg. He's not cruel by temperament, just efficient. The system does the cruelty for him. His ledger records everything: debts, payments, seizures, sales. It is meticulous, legal, and monstrous.\n\nThere is a fourth prisoner the heroes don't know about. An old man named Harven, with no family and no one coming for him. His auction is tomorrow.\n\n## GETTING THE HEROES INVOLVED\n\n**The Carpenter's Plea.** Garrett finds the heroes in the Wainwright's District at dawn. He's been up all night. His hands shake. He offers fifteen crowns and a set of tools that belonged to his grandfather\"”master-crafted, worth fifty crowns to any buyer who knows woodwork. \"I know it's not enough. I know I shouldn't have borrowed from them. But my children don't deserve to pay for what I did.\"\n\n**Brotherhood Problems.** A contact the heroes trust warns them that the Brotherhood is expanding its debtor operations into new districts. Holding House Three is the pilot. If it turns a profit\"”and it will, given three days\"”more will follow. Someone should make an example of it. Not legally, obviously. Nothing about this will be legal.\n\n**The Grandmother's Booth.** An empty market booth in the Wainwright's District tells its own story if the heroes are paying attention. Grandmother Holst\"”the woman who ran it for thirty years\"”was taken by the Tallymen last week. Her granddaughter, a girl of twelve, has been sleeping under the counter ever since, waiting. She doesn't ask for help. She doesn't know how. Heroes who notice her and ask the right questions learn that Holst is in Holding House Three.\n\n> **Connected Campaign:** If the heroes noticed the empty booth in *The Counterfeit Seal*, this scene lands with particular force\"”they saw the absence before they understood the cause.\n\n---\n\n## THE SITUATION\n\n### Part One: The Debt Quarter\n\n*Shuttered buildings, barred windows, and people who walk quickly with their eyes down. The Brotherhood's mark hangs above the door of a three-storey grey stone building on the corner of Canker Street and the canal: an open hand with a closed fist behind it. The message is clear enough.*\n\nThe Debt Quarter isn't on any official map of Mottgorte. It occupies a grey zone between guild territory and Brotherhood control. Holding House Three sits on the corner of Canker Street and the canal, and the heroes aren't breaking into a criminal den\"”they're breaking into a lawful business that happens to trade in human misery. The Watch won't interfere because the Brotherhood has permits. The Consortium won't interfere because the Brotherhood pays its taxes. Nobody with power cares, because nobody with power owes the Brotherhood money. That's rather the point.\n\n**Intelligence Gathering.** The heroes should spend time learning the building's layout and routine before they go in. Three sources provide what they need:\n\n*The Dockworkers.* Buy a round of drinks near the canal wharf and the stories come easily. Every dock worker knows someone who's been inside a Holding House. Guard shifts change at dawn and dusk. The front entrance is the only official way in. The canal-side dock handles \"quiet removals\"\"”prisoners transferred by boat at night to avoid public attention.\n\n*Sergeant Vance.* The local Watch sergeant is corrupt in the comfortable, well-established way of a man who has been taking Brotherhood coin for years. Fifty crowns buys him looking the other way for an evening. A hundred crowns gets the building layout\"”he's been inside on official business and has a sharp eye. Intimidation achieves the same result without cost, though making enemies of corrupt watchmen has consequences in Mottgorte.\n\n*The Survivor.* A woman named Pella escaped Holding House Three during a fire four years ago. She lives in Dockside, drinks too much, and doesn't sleep well. She knows the building has a canal-side dock with underwater access\"”a drainage grate large enough for a person, flooded at high tide but passable when the water drops. Persuasion draws the memory out, but it costs her. Heroes who treat her with care earn more than information.\n\n### Part Two: The Holding House\n\n*Inside, the air is thick with tallow smoke and old sweat. The common room smells of cheap ale and cheaper men. Somewhere above, through stone walls and locked doors, people are waiting to be sold.*\n\n**The Building.** Ground floor: main entrance with a guard, common room where off-duty Tallymen drink and play cards, and a kitchen with a service entrance (locked). First floor: three holding cells where prisoners are kept separately, plus a guard room for the overnight watch. Second floor: Tallyman quarters and Voss's office, where the ledgers and collected valuables are stored. Basement: canal dock with underwater access and a room the Tallymen call \"the office,\" which has a drain in the floor and a table with leather straps. Don't dwell on it. The heroes will understand.\n\n**The Guards.** Not every Tallyman is at peak readiness, and smart heroes will exploit this.\n\nVoss runs the operation from the second floor and descends only when there's trouble. He is confident but not reckless\"”if clearly outmatched, he'll retreat and return with reinforcements. He doesn't die for thirty crowns' worth of debt.\n\nGregor is drunk. It was a good collection day and he's celebrated accordingly. He's Distracted and requires two successes to recover from Shaken rather than one. He's in the common room with a bottle and a bad hand of cards.\n\nCole drew the overnight watch and has been awake for sixteen hours. He's Fatigued, and he's leaning against the guard room wall trying not to fall asleep. He will not react quickly to anything.\n\nTwo off-duty Tallymen are asleep in the second-floor quarters. If an alarm sounds, they need one full round to wake, arm themselves, and respond.\n\n### Part Three: The Rescue\n\n*Five rounds. Thirty seconds. Three cells, three locks, three frightened people who've forgotten what hope looks like. Go.*\n\n---\n\n> **ENCOUNTER: DRAMATIC TASK \"” THE RESCUE**\n>\n> **Objective:** 5 successes to free prisoners from 3 separate cells and escape the building  \n> **Rounds:** 5 (30 seconds game time)  \n> **Applicable Skills:** Thievery (picking locks), Athletics (moving quickly), Stealth (avoiding detection), Notice (tracking guard positions)  \n> **Complications (draw from Action Deck each round):**  \n> Clubs \"” Guard patrol rounds corner. Stealth vs Notice or spotted, combat begins.  \n> Spades \"” Lock jams. Next Thievery at âˆ’2.  \n> Hearts \"” Prisoner panics. Persuasion to calm or noise alerts building.  \n> Diamonds \"” Shortcut found. One free success.  \n> **Failure:** Reinforcements arrive. Dramatic Task becomes fighting retreat with 3 civilians in tow. Brotherhood reinforcements at 3/round until heroes clear for 2 full rounds.  \n> **Bennies:** Remind players this is the time to spend them. A failed lockpick at the wrong moment ends the rescue.\n\n---\n\n**If the Task Fails.** Reinforcements arrive. The Dramatic Task becomes a fighting retreat through the building, with three frightened civilians in tow. The heroes can still escape, but it won't be clean, it won't be quiet, and the Brotherhood will know exactly who was responsible.\n\n---\n\n> **ENCOUNTER: FIGHTING RETREAT (if Dramatic Task fails)**\n>\n> **Terrain:** Interior, narrow corridors, stairs between floors  \n> **Opponents:** Gregor (Distracted, âˆ’2 all rolls), Cole (Fatigued, âˆ’1 all rolls), 2 off-duty Tallymen (1 round to arm), Voss (arrives from 2nd floor, Round 2)  \n> **Complications:** 3 civilians in tow (Pace 6, Harven Pace 4). Brotherhood reinforcements arrive at 3/round from Round 3.  \n> **Duration:** 3\"“5 rounds to reach an exit  \n> **Bennies:** Voss has 2 (uses first to Soak, second on Intimidation to demand surrender\"”make it dramatic).\n\n---\n\n**The Escape.** Three routes out: canal boats at the basement dock (fast but requires someone who can row), street route through the market crowds (cover but slow, with Brotherhood pursuit), or rooftop route across the Debt Quarter (Athletics at target 6, exhilarating but terrifying for the children). Brotherhood reinforcements arrive at a rate of three per round until the heroes have been clear for two full rounds.\n\n### The Moral Dimension\n\n**The Fourth Prisoner.** In the third cell, beside Garrett's daughter Mira, sits an old man named Harven. He's thin, quiet, and resigned. He has no family. No one hired the heroes to rescue him. His auction is tomorrow.\n\nTaking Harven slows the escape. He's old, his legs are bad, and he can't climb or swim. Every practical calculation says leave him. Every heroic instinct says otherwise.\n\nThis is the test. Not whether the heroes can fight Tallymen\"”that's just dice. Whether they carry an old man out of a slave house when nobody's paying them to do it. That's character.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT IF...\n\n*The heroes try to buy the family's freedom legally?* Three hundred crowns settles the debt. Most Novice parties can't afford it. If they can, Voss releases the family without fuss\"”the Brotherhood honours contracts. But Harven is still there, and money won't help him. And the Holding House is still open tomorrow.\n\n*They go in loud?* The Dramatic Task fails automatically. Jump straight to fighting retreat. Gregor and Cole are still impaired. The building's neighbours hear everything\"”the Brotherhood's reputation takes a hit, but so does the heroes' anonymity.\n\n*They alert the Watch?* Sergeant Vance arrives, sees Brotherhood permits, and tells the heroes to leave. If the heroes bribed Vance earlier, he's conflicted\"”he'll delay his response by ten minutes but won't actively help.\n\n*They leave Harven?* The adventure works. But track it. When Harven surfaces in a later adventure\"”as a name on an auction ledger, as a ghost in a debtors' graveyard, as a man the heroes could have saved\"”the weight should be felt.\n\n---\n\n## SKILL CHECK REFERENCE\n\n| Check | Target | Context |\n|:------|:------:|:--------|\n| Notice | 6 | Spot Holst's granddaughter at market |\n| Streetwise | 4 | Learn about Holding Houses from dockworkers |\n| Intimidation vs Spirit d6 | 6+ | Pressure Sergeant Vance |\n| Persuasion vs Spirit d8 | 8+ | Draw Pella's story out |\n| Thievery | 6 | Pick kitchen service entrance lock |\n| Stealth vs Notice d4 | 4+ | Sneak past Gregor (drunk) |\n| Stealth vs Notice d6âˆ’1 | 5+ | Sneak past Cole (fatigued) |\n| Thievery | 4 | Pick cell locks (Dramatic Task) |\n| Athletics | 4 | Move quickly through building (Dramatic Task) |\n| Stealth | Varies | Avoid detection (Dramatic Task) |\n| Notice | 4 | Track guard positions (Dramatic Task) |\n| Persuasion | 4 | Calm panicking prisoner |\n| Athletics | 6 | Rooftop escape route |\n\n---\n\n## KEY NPCS\n\n### Garrett Wainwright \"” Carpenter (Civilian)\n\nNo combat stats. Owes 300â‚¡ to the Brotherhood. Will offer 15â‚¡ and master-crafted tools (worth 50â‚¡). Broken but not beaten. Potential recurring contact\"”skilled craftsman with a debt to repay.\n\n### Tallyman Voss \"” Holding House Operator (Wild Card)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d6, Smarts d8, Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d8  \n**Skills:** Fighting d8, Intimidation d10, Notice d8  \n**Pace:** 6; **Parry:** 6; **Toughness:** 7 (2)  \n**Bennies:** 2 (Soak first, Intimidation second)  \n**Gear:** Guild leathers (+2 Armour), slaver's club (Str+d4, nonlethal), manacles, 30â‚¡  \n**Special:** Professional.

Old, frail, slow (Pace 4). No family. No money. No one coming. The reason heroes exist.\n\n---\n\n## REWARDS & CONSEQUENCES\n\n**Success:** Garrett's family is free. Fifteen crowns and grandfather's tools, plus the gratitude of a man who will spend the rest of his life trying to repay a debt money can't settle. Harven, if rescued, becomes a fixture in the heroes' lives\"”he has no home and nowhere to go, but he remembers everything he saw inside the Holding House, and his memory for names and faces is remarkable.\n\n**Partial Success:** Family rescued but Brotherhood pursuit is ongoing. Voss survived and remembers every face. The Tallymen add the heroes to their ledger\"”not as debtors, but as problems to be solved.\n\n**Failure:** Garrett's family is sold. The old man is sold. The heroes must live with the knowledge that they tried and failed, or worse, that they never tried at all.\n\n**Consequences:** The Brotherhood of the Fallen Star now knows the heroes' names. This isn't a one-time consequence\"”it's a campaign-defining shift. The Brotherhood doesn't forget debts, and interference with lawful collection is, in their eyes, a debt. Tallyman Voss becomes a recurring antagonist who operates entirely within the law while making the heroes' lives as difficult as possible.\n\n---\n\n## SCALING\n\n**Seasoned.** Add a Brotherhood enforcer to the ground floor\"”a scarred veteran with Fighting d8, Vigor d8, Toughness 8(2), and a chain weapon (Str+d6, Reach 1). Voss has a bell-pull in his office that summons Watch Sergeant Vance and two constables within five rounds\"”the heroes must now contend with lawful authority as well as Brotherhood muscle.\n\n**Veteran.** Holding House Three has a bound guardian spirit in the basement\"”a wisp of malevolent energy that Voss can activate from his office (use Will-o'-the-Wisp stats: incorporeal, Fear âˆ’1, *bolt* power at d8). The canal escape route is watched by a Brotherhood boat crew (three Extras with crossbows). The Dramatic Task requires seven successes instead of five, reflecting tighter security.\n\n---\n\n## FORESHADOWING\n\nThis adventure plants seeds for future content. Don't explain them\"”just let them land:\n\n**Voss's Ledger.** If the heroes access the second-floor office, they find Voss's collection ledger. It's meticulous and horrifying\"”names, amounts owed, family members seized, auction prices received. One entry, recent, lists a debt paid in full by an anonymous benefactor. The debtor's name is \"Corwynn\"\"”a name that means nothing now, but will surface again in unexpected places.\n\n**The Disposal Room.** The basement room with the drain isn't empty. Old bloodstains, leather straps, and a collection of tools that aren't for carpentry. What the Brotherhood does to people who can't pay and can't be sold is left to the GM's judgment\"”but among the detritus, a careful search finds a scrap of parchment bearing the seal of the Covenant of Letters\"”Mottgorte's prestigious magical academy. What business does the Academy have with a Brotherhood debt house? The answer, if the heroes pursue it, is worse than they imagine.\n\n**Grandmother Holst.** If the heroes came here partly for Holst, she's in Cell 2. She's fierce, angry, and unbroken. Rescuing her alongside Garrett's family complicates the escape but connects the heroes to the Mottgorte market district's underground economy\"”useful preparation for later adventures.\n\n---\n\n## DESIGNER NOTES\n\n*The Tallyman's Ledger* is the first adventure that puts the heroes directly against Ammaria's institutional power structures. The Brotherhood isn't a criminal gang skulking in warehouses\"”it's a licensed commercial operation, and every terrible thing it does is technically legal. The Tallymen aren't villains; they're employees. That distinction should make players profoundly uncomfortable.\n\nThe Dramatic Task mechanic takes centre stage here, with the card-draw complications creating emergent narrative tension that no pre-scripted sequence can match. The pre-applied conditions on the guards\"”Gregor's drunkenness, Cole's fatigue\"”reward heroes who scout and plan rather than kicking in the front door. This is an adventure about preparation, timing, and moral courage, with combat as a consequence of failure rather than the primary challenge.\n\nThe fourth prisoner\"”Harven\"”is the heart of the adventure, and the adventure was built around him. Everything else is logistics.\n\n---\n\n*This adventure requires the Savage Worlds core rules.*  \n*Recommended: Ammaria: Land of the Merchant Guilds regional supplement.*\n\n*Product Code: DFS-AM-A003-TALLY*  \n*Â© 2026 DiceForge Studios Ltd.

Daris poisons the wine during service.\n\n---\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nSomeone is going to murder Consortium Factor Aldric Thorne at the most exclusive social event of the season. The heroes' patron has received intelligence of the plot and needs discreet protection\"”official guards would cause a panic and humiliate the host. The heroes must attend the Crimson Ball, identify the assassin from among two hundred guests, and prevent the killing without causing a scandal.\n\nThere's a complication. Aldric Thorne is a genuinely terrible person, and half the people at the ball have reason to want him dead. The assassin has the most sympathetic motive of all.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n*For the Game Master's eyes only.*\n\nThe assassin is a servant named Daris, placed in the host's household three months ago under false references. Her sister was sold to the Slave Traders' Guild after Thorne orchestrated the ruin of their family's small trading business\"”a deliberate act of commercial predation that Thorne considers routine. Daris has spent three months learning the household routines, the wine service, and where the kitchens are unobserved. She will poison Thorne's wine during the formal supper that caps the evening.\n\nDaris is not evil. She's grieving, furious, and committed. She will not be talked out of her plan easily, but she is not beyond reason. If the heroes can prove Thorne's crimes publicly\"”forcing the Consortium to act\"”she might accept that as an alternative to murder. Maybe.\n\nTwo other guests have obvious motives and will draw investigation: Lady Maren Corvane, whose husband Thorne ruined, and Kellam Voss, a merchant rival Thorne recently outmanoeuvred. Both are red herrings. The real killer is the quiet woman pouring wine.\n\n## GETTING THE HEROES INVOLVED\n\n**The Patron's Request.** Valdric Thornwood\"”or another patron the heroes have cultivated\"”calls in a favour. He's received word through his intelligence network that Thorne will be killed at the Crimson Ball. Valdric doesn't like Thorne. Nobody likes Thorne. But Thorne's death would destabilise guild markets for months, and Valdric's investments can't survive the shock. \"Keep him alive through dessert. After that, I don't care what happens to the man.\"\n\n**Social Obligation.** A hero with Noble, Rich, or connections to the Consortium receives an invitation to the ball directly. At the event, they overhear whispered speculation about a threat to Thorne, and must investigate while maintaining appearances.\n\n**Scarface Tomas.** A heavyset man with a scar running from ear to jaw approaches the heroes at a neutral location\"”a canal-side tavern, a quiet market corner. He's been watching them. How long isn't clear, but he knows their names and their recent work. He represents an unnamed interest that wants Thorne alive\"”for now. He offers two hundred crowns for the heroes to attend the ball and prevent anything unfortunate. He provides invitations and says nothing else useful. He is a mystery, and that is the point.\n\n> **Connected Campaign:** If the heroes encountered Tomas lurking in the background of *The Counterfeit Seal*, this first direct contact carries additional weight\"”the watcher finally speaks.\n\n---\n\n## THE SITUATION\n\n### Part One: Preparation\n\n*Thornwood Manor blazes with light. Carriages queue along the canal approach, each one disgorging silks, jewels, and smiles that never quite reach the eyes. Two hundred of Mottgorte's finest, gathered to celebrate something nobody remembers and scheme about everything that matters.*\n\nThe Crimson Ball is held at Thornwood Manor\"”not Valdric's property, but a public guild hall named for a different Thornwood entirely. The event begins at sundown and runs through the evening, with formal dancing, political conversation, and a seated supper at the fifth hour. Two hundred guests. Dozens of servants. More secrets per square foot than a Glasryan court.\n\n**The Problem of Weapons.** Decorative daggers are acceptable formal accessories\"”no concealment needed. A hand crossbow can be hidden in formal clothing with a Stealth roll at âˆ’2. Anything larger is impossible without magic, an elaborate deception, or a very understanding tailor. Heroes accustomed to solving problems with swords will need to adapt.\n\n**The Problem of Behaviour.** Violence at a guild ball means criminal charges, social ruin, and permanent exclusion from Mottgorte's upper circles. Even raised voices draw attention. The heroes must operate with the precision of surgeons and the manners of courtiers. Fighting is a last resort. Persuasion, Notice, and Stealth are the weapons of the evening.\n\n### Part Two: The Ball\n\n*Crystal chandeliers throw prismatic light across a hundred dancing couples. The wine flows freely, the laughter is practised, and every conversation has at least two meanings. The servants move through it all like ghosts\"”invisible to anyone who hasn't learned to look.*\n\n**The Venue.** The grand ballroom fills the ground floor\"”crowded enough that Stealth rolls gain +2 to blend in, but tight enough that Fighting rolls suffer âˆ’1 from limited space. The dining hall connects to the ballroom through double doors and will seat all two hundred guests for the formal supper. Servant passages run behind the walls, connecting every room\"”technically off-limits to guests, but accessible through unmarked doors. The gardens offer a hedge maze (heavy cover, âˆ’4 to ranged attacks through the greenery), a fountain courtyard (difficult terrain, and falling in ruins formal attire for a âˆ’2 social penalty that lasts the evening), and a service gate for deliveries and discreet exits. The upper floor holds locked private chambers and a balcony overlooking the ballroom.\n\n**Working the Room.** The heroes have roughly three hours of ball before supper begins and the assassination window opens. Each hour, a hero can attempt one social action:\n\n*Gather Gossip.* Persuasion or Performance to circulate and pick up rumours. Success identifies one suspect's motive. A raise picks up two, plus a detail about Thorne's behaviour that evening.\n\n*Observe the Servants.* Notice at âˆ’2 to spot anything unusual among the household staff. Success identifies Daris as new\"”she moves differently from servants who've worked here for years, too careful, too aware of Thorne's position at all times.\n\n*Search the Servants' Quarters.* Stealth to slip through the servant passages unnoticed, then a Notice roll to search rooms. Success in Daris's room reveals a mortar, pestle, and the dried remains of bitter nightshade among her personal effects.\n\n*Approach Thorne Directly.* Warn him. He won't listen. Without hard evidence\"”the poison itself, or a confession\"”he dismisses the heroes as paranoid social climbers and makes a pointed comment about their breeding.\n\n**The Suspects.** Sharp investigation identifies three people with reason to want Thorne dead:\n\n*Lady Maren Corvane.* Widow. Her husband's trading company collapsed after Thorne engineered a hostile buyout of their primary contract, leaving the family destitute. Corvane sold everything to maintain appearances, and her smile at Thorne across the ballroom could curdle wine. She is entirely innocent. She came tonight to watch him, not to kill him. Her alibi is solid\"”she's been in the company of Provost Aldara Kenn all evening, discussing a charitable endowment.\n\n*Kellam Voss.* Merchant. Thorne outmanoeuvred him on a shipping contract last quarter, costing his house eight hundred crowns. He has a temper and has been drinking. He is entirely innocent. He's too obvious, too loud, and too drunk to execute a subtle poisoning. If questioned, he admits he fantasises about Thorne's death daily but lacks the courage and the cunning.\n\n*Daris.* Servant. She's been with the household three months. She moves with quiet purpose, watches Thorne with steady attention, and her hands don't shake. A Streetwise check or a careful conversation with the household steward reveals her references don't quite hold up\"”the family she claims to have served doesn't employ female staff. Notice catches her watching Thorne with something more than professional attention.\n\n### Part Three: The Garden Confrontation\n\n*Moonlight and hedge-shadow. The maze swallows sound. Somewhere beyond the green walls, music plays and glasses clink. Out here, a woman with a poison vial and a broken heart waits for the hour to strike.*\n\nWhen the heroes identify Daris\"”and they should, before the fifth hour\"”the question becomes what to do about her. Confronting her inside the ball risks a scene. Following her into the gardens offers privacy and options.\n\nDaris is in the hedge maze, checking the poison vial she carries in her apron. She's expecting this moment. She's been expecting it for three months.\n\nIf cornered, Daris doesn't deny it. \"He destroyed my family. He sold my sister. The law calls it commerce. I call it murder.\" She has a concealed knife and a poison vial. She's desperate but not suicidal\"”she'll flee if she can, fight if she must, and die before she lets Thorne walk away from what he did.\n\n---\n\n> **ENCOUNTER: THE HEDGE MAZE (if combat occurs)**\n>\n> **Terrain:** Hedge maze \"” heavy cover (âˆ’4 ranged through greenery), dim lighting (âˆ’1 attacks beyond 10\"). Fountain courtyard is difficult terrain. Falling in fountain ruins formal attire (âˆ’2 social penalty rest of evening).  \n> **Opponent:** Daris (Wild Card). Flees first, fights only if cornered. Poison vial is a thrown weapon, not melee delivery.  \n> **Weapons Available:** Decorative daggers (Str+d4), concealed hand crossbows (if smuggled in). No swords, no armour.  \n> **Duration:** 2\"“3 rounds at most. Daris isn't trying to win a fight\"”she's trying to escape or complete her mission.  \n> **Bennies:** Daris has 2. Uses first on Stealth to vanish into the maze. Uses second to Soak if cornered. She's a survivor, not a martyr.\n\n---\n\n### The Moral Dimension\n\nDaris isn't wrong. Thorne is a monster who operates within the law, and Daris's sister is in chains somewhere because of his \"legitimate business practices.\" The heroes face a genuine moral choice with no clean answers:\n\n*Stop Daris.* Justice of a sort is served\"”attempted murder is a crime. But Thorne continues his predation, and Daris goes to prison or worse. The system that created this situation remains intact.\n\n*Let Daris Succeed.* Thorne dies, arguably deserving it. But the heroes have permitted murder, Daris faces execution if caught, and the guild markets destabilise as Valdric warned.\n\n*Expose Both.* Convince Daris to reveal Thorne's crimes publicly instead. This requires Persuasion against her Spirit and either hard evidence of Thorne's actions or a genuinely moving appeal to hope over vengeance. If successful, Daris testifies, Thorne is arrested, and the scandal rocks the Consortium. This is the \"best\" outcome, but it requires the heroes to be very good at their jobs.\n\n*Find Another Way.* The heroes might stage a scene that forces Thorne to flee the ball before supper, preventing the poisoning without confronting Daris at all. They might steal the poison and replace it with something harmless. They might warn the kitchen staff. Creative solutions should be rewarded.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT IF...\n\n*The heroes just warn Thorne and walk away?* He ignores the warning. Daris poisons him. He dies. Valdric is furious. The heroes get paid nothing. The markets convulse. Daris is captured and executed. Nobody wins.\n\n*They identify Daris but sympathise with her?* Excellent. Let them wrestle with it. If they actively help her, Thorne dies and the consequences play out. If they convince her to wait while they gather evidence against Thorne, that's a campaign thread\"”the evidence exists but it takes time to assemble.\n\n*They cause a scene at the ball?* Social ruin. Criminal charges if weapons are drawn. Future adventures among the merchant elite become significantly harder. The assassination is prevented by sheer chaos, which counts as success in the narrowest possible sense.\n\n*They never identify the assassin?* Thorne dies at supper. The heroes watch it happen, unable to prevent what they couldn't see coming. This is a valid outcome\"”failure teaches, and the consequences create future content.\n\n---\n\n## SKILL CHECK REFERENCE\n\n| Check | Target | Context |\n|:------|:------:|:--------|\n| Stealth (âˆ’2) | 4 | Conceal hand crossbow in formal wear |\n| Persuasion or Performance | 4 | Gather gossip (1 suspect per hour) |\n| Notice (âˆ’2) | 6 | Spot Daris as unusual among servants |\n| Stealth | 4 | Access servant passages undetected |\n| Notice | 6 | Search Daris's room for evidence |\n| Persuasion vs Spirit d10 | 10+ | Convince Thorne of danger (requires evidence) |\n| Streetwise | 8 | Discover Daris's false references |\n| Notice | 8 | Catch Daris watching Thorne with intent |\n| Common Knowledge or Research | 4 | Examine guest registry |\n| Persuasion vs Spirit d8 | 8+ | Convince Daris to expose Thorne instead |\n| Stealth (+2 crowd) | Varies | Blend into ballroom crowd |\n\n---\n\n## KEY NPCS\n\n### Consortium Factor Aldric Thorne \"” Target (Wild Card)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d4, Smarts d10, Spirit d10, Strength d6, Vigor d6  \n**Skills:** Intimidation d8, Notice d6, Persuasion d10  \n**Pace:** 6; **Parry:** 4; **Toughness:** 5  \n**Bennies:** 2 (irrelevant unless attacked\"”he won't fight)  \n**Gear:** No weapons.

He knows more than he says. He works for someone. He isn't saying who. Recurring.\n\n---\n\n## REWARDS & CONSEQUENCES\n\n**Success:** Two hundred crowns from Valdric (or Tomas, depending on the hook). Thorne survives the evening, which keeps the markets stable and Valdric grateful. Daris's fate depends on the heroes' choices\"”arrested, fled, or turned into a weapon against Thorne through legal channels. The heroes have proven they can operate in Mottgorte's upper circles, opening doors to future adventures among the merchant elite.\n\n**Partial Success:** Thorne survives but the heroes caused a scene\"”social reputation damaged, future guild invitations in doubt. Daris escapes into the night, and she remembers the heroes' faces.\n\n**Failure:** Thorne dies. The guild markets convulse. Valdric loses heavily and blames the heroes. Daris either escapes or is captured and executed. The Brotherhood moves to fill the power vacuum Thorne's death creates, expanding their operations. The heroes' reputation in Mottgorte takes a severe hit.\n\n---\n\n## SCALING\n\n**Seasoned.** Daris has an accomplice\"”a second servant who will create a distraction (small fire in the kitchens) while Daris poisons the wine, splitting the heroes' attention. Thorne has his own bodyguard (use Skilled Extra: Fighting d8, Notice d8; Parry 6; Toughness 7(1); concealed shortsword) who complicates any direct approach.\n\n**Veteran.** The assassination is backed by a rival Consortium faction. Daris is merely the weapon; the true architect is a guest at the ball, watching through a *detect arcana* spell. If the heroes prevent the poisoning, the backup plan is a crossbow bolt from the balcony during the toast. Add a Dramatic Task (3 successes in 3 rounds) to spot the shooter before the shot is fired.\n\n---\n\n## FORESHADOWING\n\nThis adventure plants seeds for future content. Don't explain them\"”just let them land:\n\n**Scarface Tomas.** If the heroes took his hook, he collects them after the ball and pays without comment. He is visibly pleased by competence and says only: \"You'll hear from me again.\" He works for one of the Circles\"”which one depends on where the campaign goes. For now, he is a thread without a destination, and that is precisely the point.\n\n**The Guest List.** Among the two hundred names at the Crimson Ball, a hero who examines the guest registry notices an entry struck through and rewritten: \"Provost A. Kenn, Covenant of Letters.\" The original name, barely visible beneath the correction, reads \"M. Thane.\" The Academy's vanished wizard was invited to this ball. Someone uninvited him.\n\n**Thorne's Debts.** If the heroes investigate Thorne's background to verify Daris's claims, they discover that Thorne's commercial predation isn't random\"”he targets specific families, always those with minor arcane connections or hedge-magic traditions. The pattern isn't obvious from a single case, but it's there if someone looks.\n\n---\n\n## DESIGNER NOTES\n\n*The Crimson Invitation* is a social adventure with the potential for violence, not a combat adventure with social elements. The distinction matters. Every significant challenge in this adventure is resolved through Notice, Persuasion, Stealth, and player ingenuity. The fight with Daris in the hedge maze is an optional confrontation that many groups will resolve through conversation rather than combat.\n\nThe adventure showcases Social Conflict and investigation mechanics while introducing Concealed Weapons rules and environmental conditions that matter in social rather than tactical contexts. The moral dimension\"”Daris's genuine grievance versus the heroes' obligation to prevent murder\"”creates the kind of table conversation that makes campaigns memorable.\n\nScarface Tomas is designed as a slow-burn recurring figure\"”mysterious, competent, and unexplained. Resist the temptation to reveal who he works for. Mystery is a resource. Spend it slowly.\n\n---\n\n*This adventure requires the Savage Worlds core rules.*  \n*Recommended: Ammaria: Land of the Merchant Guilds regional supplement.*\n\n*Product Code: DFS-AM-A004-CRIM*  \n*Â© 2026 DiceForge Studios Ltd.

The heroes aren't the only option\"”just the quietest.\n\n---\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nA junior wizard named Marcus Thane has barricaded himself inside a tower at the Covenant of Letters, Mottgorte's academy of arcane learning. The Academy wants him removed quietly. They're calling it a breakdown\"”dangerous experiments, unstable magic, a young man who pushed too hard and cracked. They're lying.\n\nThane discovered evidence that the Academy collaborated with Glasrya during the Sacramentum Ignis, a purge of hedge-mages and unlicensed practitioners fifty years ago. Hundreds died. The Academy provided the names. Thane found the lists, and now the people who signed them want him silenced.\n\nThe heroes are hired to extract a wizard from a warded tower. What they find inside will change how they see Mottgorte forever.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n*For the Game Master's eyes only.*\n\nFifty years ago, Glasryan inquisitors conducted the Sacramentum Ignis\"”the Trial of Fire\"”across Ammaria's major cities. Officially, it targeted dangerous heretics and rogue practitioners. In reality, it was a systematic cull of anyone who could provide magical services outside guild-controlled channels. Healers, hedge-witches, village wise-women, and minor practitioners were identified, arrested, and executed or sold into Glasryan service.\n\nThe Covenant of Letters didn't merely cooperate. They curated the lists. Senior faculty identified colleagues, former students, and independent practitioners who competed with guild interests, and handed their names to Glasryan inquisitors with full knowledge of the consequences. The arrangement was voluntary\"”not coerced\"”and the documents in Thane's basement prove it.\n\nProvost Aldara Kenn was not involved in the original purge. She inherited the cover-up. She wants the evidence destroyed, not because she's evil, but because she believes the revelation would tear the Academy apart and damage Mottgorte's magical infrastructure. She may even be right. That doesn't make her honest.\n\n## GETTING THE HEROES INVOLVED\n\n**The Academy's Request.** Provost Kenn summons the heroes through official channels\"”or through Valdric, if they've established that relationship. She offers two hundred crowns for \"discrete extraction\" of a troubled student. She's polished, articulate, and not quite telling the truth. Notice catches the evasion in her eyes when she describes Thane's \"dangerous experiments.\" She claims the tower's wards prevent forced entry and that the Academy needs \"specialists who can negotiate.\"\n\n**The Wizard's Message.** Thane has been sending encoded messages to people he trusts\"”fragments of text hidden in seemingly innocent academic correspondence. One of these reaches the heroes through a mutual contact, a former student who knows their reputation: \"They gave them names. The Covenant gave them names. I have proof. Help me.\" The message is desperate, cryptic, and carries the distinctive ink of Academy correspondence. Someone inside Mottgorte's most respected institution is terrified of the institution itself.\n\n> **Connected Campaign:** If the heroes encountered Thane's name on the guest list in *The Crimson Invitation*, the message confirms what the struck-through entry suggested\"”the Academy silenced him before the ball.\n\n**The Covenant's Debt.** Rumours in the Scholar's Quarter suggest the Covenant of Letters has skeletons buried deeper than its famous libraries. A sealed tower, a missing wizard, whispered arguments between faculty members after hours. Heroes with Streetwise or connections to Mottgorte's educated circles hear the gossip easily enough. A discreet inquiry at the Academy gates prompts Provost Kenn to seek them out rather than wait\"”she'd rather hire them than have them asking questions independently.\n\n> **Connected Campaign:** If the heroes found the Academy seal in the Holding House basement during *The Tallyman's Ledger*, they already know the Covenant has secrets worth keeping\"”and Kenn's offer takes on a distinctly defensive tone.\n\n---\n\n## THE SITUATION\n\n### Part One: The Academy\n\n*Pale stone and manicured courtyards, where students argue philosophy and lecturers pretend to ignore them. It looks like a place where knowledge is treasured. It is a place where knowledge is controlled. There's a difference, and the tower rising from the eastern corner\"”dark-windowed, faintly pulsing with ward-light\"”is proof of it.*\n\nThe Covenant of Letters occupies a walled compound in Mottgorte's Scholar's Quarter. Thane's tower rises from the compound's eastern corner, a four-storey cylinder of grey granite older than the Academy itself. Its windows are dark. Faint light pulses behind the shutters at irregular intervals\"”the wards, breathing.\n\nProvost Kenn receives the heroes in her office, which is lined with books she has actually read and certificates she has genuinely earned. She is intelligent, cautious, and playing a game the heroes don't yet understand. Her story: Thane is conducting unsanctioned experiments, his wards are dangerous, and the Academy needs outside help because their own faculty can't bypass his protections without risking a magical incident that would embarrass everyone.\n\nWhat she's hiding: Thane found the Sacramentum Ignis archive in a sealed basement beneath the tower. The evidence implicates faculty who served fifty years ago\"”most now dead\"”but also the institutional decision that authorised cooperation with Glasrya. Kenn's predecessor signed the lists. The current Academy budget includes a line item that traces back to payments received for the betrayal. The cover-up is older than Kenn's career, and she has decided\"”perhaps correctly\"”that it is more important than the truth.\n\n**What the Heroes Can Learn Before Entering.** Talking to students reveals that Thane was obsessed with Academy history and spent weeks in the restricted archives before his \"breakdown.\" Talking to faculty (harder\"”they've been warned) reveals that the sealed basement exists and that access to it was restricted long before Thane's incident. A hero with the Scholar Edge or Academics at d8+ recognises the Sacramentum Ignis as historical fact\"”a Glasryan purge\"”but won't find it in any Academy curriculum.\n\n### Part Two: The Tower\n\n*The door hums. Not with sound\"”with pressure, the kind you feel behind your eyes. The wards are alive in the way that a cornered animal is alive: exhausted, desperate, and dangerous to touch.*\n\nFour floors and a hidden basement. The wards on the main entrance are Thane's work\"”competent but exhausted, like the man who cast them.\n\n---\n\n> **ENCOUNTER: DRAMATIC TASK \"” WARD BYPASS**\n>\n> **Objective:** 4 successes to disable the entrance wards  \n> **Applicable Skills:** Spellcasting, Thievery, Academics, Notice  \n> **Failure Consequence:** Each failed round triggers defensive discharge \"” 2d6 damage to character in contact with ward, plus alarm alerts Thane  \n> **Alternative Entry:** Basement drainage access from compound cistern system (Notice at âˆ’2 or Survival to find). Bypasses wards entirely but puts heroes in the archive before meeting Thane\"”changes the dynamic considerably.  \n> **Bennies:** Worth spending here. A failed round costs 2d6 damage AND alerts the tower.\n\n---\n\nHeroes who don't want to risk the wards have alternatives. The basement has a separate entrance\"”a drainage access from the compound's old cistern system, discoverable by searching the grounds. This bypasses the wards entirely but puts the heroes in the archive before they meet Thane, which changes the dynamic considerably.\n\n**The Animated Guardian.** If the wards are triggered, or if the heroes force the main entrance, an animated suit of armour in the entry hall activates. This is a real threat to Novice characters and should be played as one.\n\n---\n\n> **ENCOUNTER: ANIMATED ARMOUR**\n>\n> **Terrain:** Tower entry hall, narrow (2 characters abreast maximum)  \n> **Opponent:** Animated Armour (Construct). Hardy + Construct = shrugs off most hits and keeps coming. Immune to Intimidation, Fear, poison, disease. Ignores 1 level of Wound penalties. +2 to recover from Shaken.  \n> **Weak Point:** Power gem in chest plate \"” Called Shot at âˆ’6, or grapple + Thievery at TN 8 to remove. Disables instantly.  \n> **Bypass Options:** Basement entrance avoids entirely. Lure into confined space where it can't swing. Outrun it (Pace 5, it won't leave the tower).  \n> **Duration:** 3\"“5 rounds if fought head-on. 1 round if gem removed.  \n> **Bennies:** None (Construct). Save yours for the gem extraction.\n\n---\n\nThe guardian is durable\"”Hardy plus Construct means it shrugs off most hits and keeps coming. But it can be bypassed through the basement entrance, outsmarted by luring it into a confined space where it can't swing effectively, or disabled by removing the power gem embedded in its chest plate. Heroes who fight it head-on will win, but they'll spend resources they might need later.\n\n### Part Three: Marcus Thane\n\n*Scattered papers, empty food tins, and the acrid smell of a man who hasn't slept properly in days. The wizard sits at a desk surrounded by documents, and he looks exactly like someone who has been awake for seventy-two hours staring at evidence of an atrocity.*\n\nMarcus Thane is Exhausted\"”two levels of Fatigue, âˆ’2 to all rolls. He has *bolt*, *barrier*, and *detect arcana* prepared, but he will not attack unless the heroes attack first. He is too tired, too frightened, and too desperate for someone to listen.\n\n\"They gave them names,\" he says. \"The Academy. Our Academy. They made lists of hedge-mages, healers, midwives\"”anyone who practised outside guild control. And they gave those lists to Glasryan inquisitors. Hundreds died. The Academy was paid for every name.\"\n\nThe evidence is in the basement archive: original documents bearing Academy seals and Glasryan counter-signatures, lists of names organised by district and profession, and personal correspondence between the then-Provost and a Glasryan liaison that makes clear the arrangement was initiated by the Academy, not demanded by the Empire. The names on the lists include family names still prominent in Mottgorte. Some of the descendants are current Academy students.\n\n### The Moral Dimension\n\nThe heroes hold the truth. What they do with it defines their relationship with Mottgorte's power structures for the rest of the campaign.\n\n*Give the evidence to Kenn.* Two hundred crowns, Academy gratitude, evidence destroyed. The cover-up continues. The families of victims never learn what happened. The Academy's reputation is preserved. Kenn is relieved, and she remembers the heroes as people who understand how power works.\n\n*Expose the truth.* No payment. The Academy becomes an enemy. Families of victims learn what happened to their grandparents. Public outrage, political upheaval, possible violence against current faculty who bear no personal guilt. The Consortium and Brotherhood both exploit the chaos. Kenn's career is destroyed. The Academy may not survive.\n\n*Keep the evidence.* Leverage over the most powerful academic institution in Mottgorte. Marcus is protected but paranoid, and the heroes are playing a dangerous game with dangerous people. The evidence is a weapon, but weapons attract attention.\n\n*Help Marcus flee.* Evidence preserved, Marcus disappears to another city or into hiding. The Academy suspects but can't prove anything. The truth exists somewhere, waiting. This is the quietest option and the one that costs the least\"”until someone finds Marcus, or the evidence, or both.\n\n**Complications that make the choice harder:** Some current students are descendants of victims who deserved to know decades ago. Some current faculty are descendants of collaborators who will be destroyed socially by association. The Glasryans, characteristically, don't care either way\"”it was fifty years ago, and human memory is inconveniently short.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT IF...\n\n*The heroes enter through the basement first?* They find the archive before meeting Thane. This is actually a better dramatic sequence for some groups\"”they discover the horror, then meet the man trying to expose it. Adjust Thane's dialogue accordingly; he's relieved rather than desperate if they already know.\n\n*They hand Thane over to Kenn without entering the tower?* Kenn pays. Thane disappears into \"Academy care.\" The evidence is destroyed. The heroes never learn what was in the basement. This is a valid outcome\"”but if they learn the truth later, the weight of complicity should land hard.\n\n*They fight the armour and burn through resources?* That's the lesson. The tower teaches lateral thinking. If they brute-force every obstacle, they'll reach Thane exhausted and low on bennies. Thane himself is not a threat\"”but the moral choice doesn't require hit points, and tired heroes make different decisions than fresh ones.\n\n*They try to expose the truth AND protect Marcus?* Ambitious. It requires finding someone powerful enough to shelter a whistleblower against the Academy. Valdric might, for a price. The Keepers of the Sacred Flame might, for principle. The Brotherhood would love the leverage. Each protector comes with strings.\n\n---\n\n## SKILL CHECK REFERENCE\n\n| Check | Target | Context |\n|:------|:------:|:--------|\n| Notice | 8 | Catch Kenn's evasion during briefing |\n| Persuasion | 6 | Get information from students |\n| Persuasion | 8 | Get information from warned faculty |\n| Academics d8+ or Scholar | Auto | Recognise Sacramentum Ignis |\n| Spellcasting/Thievery/Academics/Notice | 4 | Dramatic Task: bypass wards (4 successes) |\n| Notice (âˆ’2) or Survival | 6 | Find basement drainage entrance |\n| Fighting (Called Shot âˆ’6) | 10+ | Target armour's power gem |\n| Thievery (after grapple) | 8 | Remove power gem from armour |\n| Persuasion vs Spirit d6 | 6+ | Convince Thane to trust the heroes |\n| Notice (âˆ’2) | 6 | Find Academy seal scrap in basement |\n| Research or Common Knowledge | 6 | Cross-reference purge names with current families |\n\n---\n\n## KEY NPCS\n\n### Provost Aldara Kenn \"” Academy Administrator (Wild Card)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d4, Smarts d10, Spirit d8, Strength d4, Vigor d6  \n**Skills:** Academics d10, Notice d8, Persuasion d8, Research d10  \n**Pace:** 6; **Parry:** 4; **Toughness:** 5  \n**Bennies:** 2 (uses them on Persuasion to maintain the lie, not combat)  \n**Gear:** No weapons.  \n**Special:** Intelligent, pragmatic, and genuinely believes she's protecting the Academy. She inherited a cover-up and chose to maintain it. Whether that makes her complicit or practical depends on your perspective.\n\n### Marcus Thane \"” Junior Wizard (Wild Card)\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d6, Smarts d10, Spirit d6, Strength d6, Vigor d6  \n**Skills:** Academics d10, Notice d6, Research d8, Spellcasting d8  \n**Pace:** 6; **Parry:** 4; **Toughness:** 5  \n**Bennies:** 1 (nearly spent maintaining the wards)  \n**Pre-Applied:** Exhausted (2 levels Fatigue, âˆ’2 all rolls)  \n**Powers:** *Bolt* (2d6), *barrier*, *detect arcana*. 15 Power Points (7 remaining).  \n**Special:** Brilliant, exhausted, and terrified. Will not fight unless attacked. Desperate for someone\"”anyone\"”to care about what he's found.\n\n### Animated Armour \"” Construct\n\n**Attributes:** Agility d6, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d10, Vigor d10  \n**Skills:** Fighting d8  \n**Pace:** 5; **Parry:** 6; **Toughness:** 10 (3)  \n**Abilities:** Armour +3 (metal construction), Construct (+2 to recover from Shaken, immune to poison and disease, ignores 1 level of Wound penalties), Hardy (second Shaken does not cause a Wound), Fearless (immune to Intimidation and Fear)  \n**Weak Point:** Power gem in chest plate (Called Shot âˆ’6 or grapple + Thievery TN 8)  \n**Special:** Relentless but slow. Won't leave the tower. Can be outrun, outthought, or dismantled.\n\n---\n\n## REWARDS & CONSEQUENCES\n\n**Success (Academy definition):** Two hundred crowns, Kenn's gratitude, doors open at the Covenant. The truth stays buried. Marcus is handed over to \"Academy care,\" which means silenced one way or another.\n\n**Success (Heroes' definition):** Variable. The truth is preserved, Marcus is alive and free, and the heroes have made a choice they can live with. Payment depends on which path they chose.\n\n**Consequences:** Whichever path the heroes choose, the Covenant of Letters remembers. If the heroes buried the truth, Kenn becomes an ally with limits\"”she'll help them, but she'll also watch them. If they exposed it, the Academy fractures, creating both enemies and unexpected allies among faculty and students who'd been waiting for this reckoning. Either way, the heroes now know something about how Mottgorte's institutions protect themselves, and that knowledge changes every interaction going forward.\n\n---\n\n## SCALING\n\n**Seasoned.** Add a second animated guardian on the second floor, and increase the Dramatic Task to five successes. Kenn has hired a mercenary mage (use War Wizard stats: Spellcasting d8, *bolt*, *stun*, *deflection*; 20 Power Points) to watch the tower exterior\"”the heroes must deal with him before or during their approach.\n\n**Veteran.** The sealed basement contains more than documents. A Glasryan binding circle was used during the Sacramentum Ignis to contain captured practitioners before transport. The circle is still active, weakly, and something whispers from it\"”a fragment of a practitioner's spirit, trapped for fifty years. The spirit can provide testimony that no document can match, but freeing it requires a Spellcasting roll at âˆ’4 and carries the risk of attracting Glasryan attention. Add a Fear check (âˆ’1) when the heroes first hear the voice.\n\n---\n\n## FORESHADOWING\n\nThis adventure plants seeds for future content. Don't explain them\"”just let them land:\n\n**The S.O.T. File.** Among the Sacramentum Ignis documents, a separate folder marked \"S.O.T.\"\"”Shadow of the Throne. Its contents describe something the Glasryans were actually searching for during the purge, something that wasn't a person. The file is incomplete. Its completion lies in Blackmere, in Phase 6. Don't explain it. Let the players wonder.\n\n**The Keepers' Interest.** Word of the Academy's sealed tower reaches the Keepers of the Sacred Flame. A young acolyte approaches the heroes after the adventure and asks, very carefully, whether the tower contained \"records of the old trials.\" The Keepers remember the Sacramentum Ignis. They lost people too. This is a thread that extends well beyond the Academy's walls\"”the purge touched every faith, every community, every family with even a whisper of arcane talent.\n\n> **Connected Campaign:** If any hero previously sought healing from the Keepers\"”particularly for the Filth Fever contracted in *The Flooded Warren*\"”this approach feels personal rather than institutional, and the acolyte trusts the heroes enough to speak more freely.\n\n**Thorne's Pattern.** The Sacramentum Ignis lists contain family names still prominent in Mottgorte\"”and a hero with Research or Common Knowledge notices something unsettling. Several of these families have suffered unusual commercial misfortune in recent years. Businesses foreclosed, properties seized, children withdrawn from the Academy. Someone is still targeting families with arcane bloodlines, fifty years after the purge officially ended. Whether this is coincidence, institutional inertia, or something more deliberate is a question the heroes aren't yet equipped to answer\"”but the pattern, once seen, cannot be unseen.\n\n> **Connected Campaign:** If the heroes investigated Aldric Thorne's predatory business practices in *The Crimson Invitation*, the connection is immediate and horrifying\"”Thorne's targets overlap with the purge lists. He isn't randomly predatory. He's continuing the work.\n\n---\n\n## DESIGNER NOTES\n\n*The Sealed Tower* forces the heroes to confront the institutional machinery that makes Ammaria function. Where other adventures deal with individuals\"”forgers, monsters, debt collectors, assassins\"”this one reveals that the institutions themselves are complicit in systemic cruelty, and that the people running those institutions aren't cackling villains but pragmatic administrators making calculated decisions about acceptable harm.\n\nThe adventure showcases Dramatic Tasks (ward bypass), Construct combat (the animated armour), and Research/Academics skill challenges as its primary Savage Worlds mechanics. The animated armour is deliberately overtuned for Novice characters to teach the lesson that not every obstacle is best solved through direct combat\"”the basement bypass and the power-gem removal both reward lateral thinking.\n\nThe moral dimension here is the strongest of the first five weeks. There is no clean answer. Every option has consequences the heroes will live with for the rest of the campaign. That's the point. Welcome to Ammaria.\n\n---\n\n*This adventure requires the Savage Worlds core rules.*  \n*Recommended: Ammaria: Land of the Merchant Guilds regional supplement.*\n\n*Product Code: DFS-AM-A005-TOWER*  \n*Â© 2026 DiceForge Studios Ltd.
