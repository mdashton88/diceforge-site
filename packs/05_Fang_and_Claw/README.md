## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Mech Starter** provides 10 walkers with core laser and missile weapons — scout, striker, battle mech, assault, missile boat, command, quad, jump, anti-air, and siege. Basic lance operations work tonight.

The **Fang & Claw supplement** adds pilot bonding mechanics, expanded melee weapons (power fists, chainswords, energy blades), stomp attacks, cockpit hit tables, salvage rules, and arena combat. The deep packs then deliver specialised mechs designed around those systems.

## .vfx Gaps

**Mech .vfx:** Melee weapon system (power fist, chain blade, energy sword), stomp attack, cockpit hit table, pilot bonding, heat management, jump jet mod, grapple arm, transformation rules (Aerospace Mech), neural link (Kaiju Defence Force), drift compatibility

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Mech Starter: "First Sortie"
**Inspired by:** The universal mech story — green pilots in untested machines facing their first real engagement. Every mech franchise starts here.

**Setup:** A lance of four mechs (scout, striker, battle mech, command) deploys to investigate a sensor contact in a canyon system. Training exercise? Hostile incursion? The briefing was vague.

**Complications:** The canyon jams communications. The "sensor contact" is a quad walker — bigger than anything in the briefing. The scout's jump jets malfunction. A second hostile force appears on the ridge above. The command mech's tactical relay detects a friendly distress signal from deeper in the canyon.

**Vehicles Used:** Scout Mech, Striker Mech, Battle Mech, Command Mech, Quad Walker (hostile), Anti-Air Mech (reinforcement)

**Variant — "The Arena":** Gladiatorial mech combat. Two-on-two in a ruined city. The crowd wants spectacle. The sponsors want their pilots alive. The bookmakers want a fix.

### Kaiju Defence Force: "Pacific Breach"
**Inspired by:** The universal kaiju scenario — something enormous emerges from the deep and walks toward a city. The conventional military is insufficient. The jaegers are humanity's last response.

**Setup:** A Category III kaiju makes landfall near a coastal city. A light jaeger and heavy jaeger deploy from the local shatterdome. Conventional forces (anti-kaiju tank, naval destroyer refit, VTOL interceptors) provide support. Evacuation is 40 minutes from complete.

**Variant — "The Double Event":** Two kaiju. One shatterdome. The heavy jaeger can fight one. The light jaeger must delay the other. The artillery walkers set up a kill zone on the highway — if the kaiju follows the predicted path.
