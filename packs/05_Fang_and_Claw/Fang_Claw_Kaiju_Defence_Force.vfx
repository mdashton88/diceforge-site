      "notes": "The light jaeger is your agile kaiju-fighter. She dodges attacks that would crush heavier mechs and targets specific weak points \u2014 eyes, gill slits, exposed organs. Use her for players who prefer finesse over brute force. She can't take a direct hit from a kaiju limb.",

      "notes": "The heavy jaeger is your Pacific Rim fantasy. She stands in front of the kaiju and punches it. The fight is cinematic \u2014 grapples, throws, improvised weapons made from shipping containers and bridge sections. Use opposed Strength rolls for the melee exchanges.

She fires from prepared positions and relocates before the monster reaches her.",
      "notes": "The anti-kaiju tank is your ranged fire support. She softens the kaiju before the jaegers close to melee range. Use her in batteries of four to six, firing from different angles. Each tank is expendable individually \u2014 the formation matters, not the individual vehicle.",
