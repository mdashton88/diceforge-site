      "notes": "The scout walker is your reconnaissance mech. She moves fast and spots targets for heavier units. Use her for scouting missions where the players need to map enemy positions without being caught. If she's detected, she runs \u2014 she can't survive a stand-up fight with battle mechs.",

      "notes": "The striker is your harassment mech. She peels off flanking shots at distracted heavies, targets damaged components, and forces the enemy to split their attention. Use her in pairs \u2014 one attacks while the other repositions. She dies to a solid hit, so she never stops moving.",
