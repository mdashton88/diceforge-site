## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Steampunk Starter** provides 10 steam-era vehicles using WW-era weapons and torpedoes — steam tank, clockwork spider, ornithopter, ironclad monitor, walking fortress, armoured train, steam carriage, aerial gunboat, submarine (Nautilus), and difference engine walker.

The **Brass & Steam supplement** adds boiler pressure mechanics (push the engine harder, risk explosion), clockwork engine types (wind-up duration, maintenance), steam burst attacks, and aesthetics-as-mechanics (a beautifully crafted machine performs better because the maker cared). The Victorian Arsenal pack delivers vehicles designed to use those systems — from steam carriages with pressure-relief weapons to analytical engine-guided automata.

## .vfx Gaps

**Steampunk .vfx:** Boiler pressure framework (overpressure risk/reward), clockwork engine (wind-up duration, reliability), steam burst attack, aesthetics bonus (craftsmanship quality), pressure relief weapon, analytical engine guidance mod, coal/fuel consumption

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Steampunk Starter: "The Trans-Continental Express"
**Inspired by:** Every great train story — the Orient Express, the Trans-Siberian, Doyle's Moriarty pursuit. Add steam-powered walking machines and a clockwork assassin and you've got a very Savage evening.

**Setup:** The heroes are aboard a luxury armoured train crossing a continental empire. The train carries a diplomatic delegation, a sealed vault, and — unknown to most passengers — a difference engine walker in the cargo car. Someone aboard has been murdered. The train doesn't stop for 600 miles.

**Complications:** The clockwork spider in the luggage car activates and begins patrolling — it's a security automaton, but whose? A walking fortress blocks the track at a mountain pass and demands the vault's contents. The ornithopter that was supposed to provide aerial escort hasn't checked in. The boiler pressure is climbing — the engineer is dead at his post. The submarine Nautilus surfaces in the lake the track runs alongside and signals with a lamp.

**Vehicles Used:** Armoured Train, Clockwork Spider, Walking Fortress, Ornithopter, Difference Engine Walker, Submarine (Nautilus)

**Variant — "The Ironclad Race":** Two ironclad monitors race up a river to claim a newly discovered territory for their respective empires. Sabotage, river obstacles, and a steam tank waiting at the finish line.
