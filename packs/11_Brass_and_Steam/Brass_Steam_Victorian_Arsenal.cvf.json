      "desc": "The arsenal variant \u2014 heavier armour, bigger gun, and a boiler rated for sustained combat operations. She's the military's official answer to the question of what happens when you put a cannon inside an iron box and make it move.",
      "notes": "The arsenal steam tank is the military-grade variant. Better armour, bigger gun, proper fire control. Use her as the standard military vehicle for steampunk war campaigns. She's what the government fields while the inventors build the weird stuff.",

      "notes": "The military spider has combat programming \u2014 she can execute basic tactical manoeuvres autonomously. This means the pilot can focus on weapons while she handles movement. The programming can also glitch, creating amusing and dangerous malfunctions.",

      "notes": "The arsenal ornithopter is your steampunk attack aircraft. She's armed and armoured at the cost of handling. Use her for air-to-ground strikes where precision matters less than the shock of bombs falling from mechanical wings.",

      "notes": "The military steam carriage is your officer transport and your command vehicle. She carries VIPs through dangerous territory. Escorting her is a mission; ambushing her is an opportunity. The officer inside always has intelligence worth capturing.",

      "notes": "The arsenal monitor is the serious warship variant. She defends ports, bombards coastal positions, and controls waterways. Use her for naval campaigns where the players must deal with a vessel that can't be outrun and can barely be hurt.",

She's the strategic bomber of the steampunk age \u2014 slow, majestic, and terrifyingly effective against anyone who can't reach her altitude.",
      "notes": "The Victorian zeppelin is your strategic air asset. She carries troops, bombs, and observation equipment. Her hydrogen lifting gas makes her vulnerable to incendiary weapons, which creates the classic risk: devastating from altitude, catastrophically vulnerable to fire.",

      "notes": "The military submarine is your steampunk U-boat. She torpedoes, she mines, she disappears. Use her for naval campaigns where the players hunt or are hunted by something they can't see. Depth charges and ram attacks are the counters.",

Use them in formations \u2014 the players face a line of clockwork soldiers that advance steadily and fire in perfect unison. The counter is unpredictability.",
