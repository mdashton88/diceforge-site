      "notes": "The Victorian steam tank variant emphasises the engineering challenge. Track coal and water as resources. The engineer maintains boiler pressure while the gunner fires and the commander navigates. Three crew roles, three players, constant resource management.",

      "notes": "This clockwork spider variant emphasises cost and rarity. She's irreplaceable in the field \u2014 there's no factory to produce spares. Damage to her mechanisms requires a skilled clockmaker, not a blacksmith. Use her as the special asset the military can't afford to lose.",
