## Starter Pack Model

Genre Starter packs use existing core tool weapons only — no .vfx extensions required. They provide basic stat blocks that let GMs run sessions immediately. When the full parent supplement ships, it adds genre-specific mechanics (crew stations, pilot bonding, possession rules, etc.) and the deep expansion packs deliver vehicles built to use those mechanics.

Each Starter validates demand for its parent supplement before that supplement is written.

## File Format

Each .cvf.json file contains:
- `formatVersion`: Schema version (currently "1.0")
- `packName`: Human-readable product name
- `packId`: Internal identifier
- `price`: Retail price
- `vehicleCount`: Number of vehicles in the pack
- `publisher`: DiceForge Studios Ltd.
- `note`: (Starters only) Upgrade path description
- `vehicles[]`: Array of vehicle definitions

## Pricing

- **Core Tool:** Free
- **Starter Packs:** $2.99 each
- **Expansion Packs:** $2.99-$3.99 each
- **Theatre Supplements:** $4.99-$7.99 each (includes rules + .vfx + 3 pre-built vehicles)
