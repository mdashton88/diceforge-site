      "notes": "This variant emphasises folklore over generic horror. The death coach follows specific rules \u2014 she can't cross running water, she arrives only at night, and iron horseshoes on the door delay her. Use these folk protections as puzzle elements the players must discover.",

      "notes": "This variant has a corporate horror angle. The train was built deliberately, not cursed accidentally. Someone made a knowing bargain. The players trace the history back to the original deal and must find a way to break the contract \u2014 which means confronting whatever was on the other side of the bargain.",

      "notes": "This variant has a sympathetic backstory. The chariot and its driver have a legitimate grievance \u2014 their people were murdered and their bones desecrated. The players must decide whether to destroy the chariot or help it achieve justice, knowing that its methods are monstrous even if its cause is righteous.",

      "notes": "This variant combines WWII history with occult horror. The submarine carries an artefact that animates the dead crew. The players discover the wreck, board her, and must deal with both the undead crew and the artefact that controls them. Destroying the sub doesn't help \u2014 the artefact survives.",

She breaks through from the other side during thin moments \u2014 eclipses, solstices, sites of mass death \u2014 and the things she kills join her crew.",

The players can bargain with him, fight him, or try to break his curse. Breaking it requires finding something specific \u2014 a willing sacrifice, a holy relic, or an act of genuine compassion.",

      "notes": "This variant adds a mundane conspiracy layer. The funeral home is real, the director is human, and he's been complicit for decades because the hearse makes his business profitable. The players investigate the funeral home as a mundane mystery that turns supernatural when they follow the hearse at midnight.",

Inside is the witch's home \u2014 rooms that are larger than the exterior suggests, shelves of impossible ingredients, and a fireplace that talks. The hut defends itself, which means the players fight a building. Use her as a mobile dungeon that shows up uninvited.",
