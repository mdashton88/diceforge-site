      "notes": "The expansion death coach is the folklore version \u2014 more specific, more terrifying. The headless driver is a dullahan, a powerful undead foe. She doesn't just collect the dead; she causes death by speaking the victim's name. The players must stop her before she speaks.",

      "notes": "The expansion ghost ship is the mystery variant. She's not actively hostile \u2014 she's a puzzle. The players board her to determine what happened to the crew. Each clue deepens the mystery and the horror. The ship remembers what happened and replays it in fragments.",

      "notes": "The expansion automobile has a personality. She's protective of her owner, jealous of rivals, and murderous toward threats. The horror is emotional \u2014 the owner loves the car, the car loves the owner, and people keep dying. The players must convince the owner to let go.",

The players ride through, encountering echoes of the dead who are being processed. The destination is the final judgement \u2014 and the players aren't dead yet, which causes problems.",

      "notes": "The expansion bone chariot is personal. She hunts a specific NPC \u2014 the person who killed the bones' original owner. The players are caught in the middle: the NPC claims innocence, the chariot disagrees, and the truth is more complicated than either side admits.",

      "notes": "The expansion submarine is the time-displacement variant. The crew are human, not undead \u2014 they're confused and frightened, not evil. The horror is the tragedy: they can't go home, they can't accept what's happened, and the players have to decide what to do with eighty men who've been dead for decades.",

She crossed into the mortal world through a breach in the veil and she's looking for a way back \u2014 through whatever stands between her and the gate.",
      "notes": "The expansion infernal war machine is on a mission. She's not random \u2014 she's heading toward a specific location for a specific reason.

      "notes": "The expansion Dutchman is the sympathetic version. The captain is trapped, not malicious. The players can break the curse \u2014 but the price is terrible and the method requires entering the ship's domain, where time moves differently and the dead crew want desperately to be alive again.",

The undertaker driving her has been doing this since 1888.",
      "notes": "The expansion hearse is the collector of the forgotten dead. She appears when someone who died in sin is buried. The players encounter her when a recently deceased NPC \u2014 perhaps a friend \u2014 is on her list.
