## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Horror Starter** provides 10 supernatural vehicles as basic stat blocks — death coach, ghost ship, possessed car, soul engine train, bone chariot, infernal war machine, Flying Dutchman, hearse of the damned, cursed submarine, and witch's hut. These work as encounter obstacles or set-piece threats using standard Savage Worlds fear and damage rules.

The **Dread & Ruin supplement** adds possession mechanics (the vehicle fights the driver), vehicle malice AI (the vehicle has its own agenda), cursed vehicle rules (cannot be destroyed by normal means), sentient vehicle personality tables, and soul engine power sources. The Haunted Vehicles pack delivers builds designed around those systems.

## .vfx Gaps

**Horror .vfx:** Possession framework, vehicle malice/sentience AI, cursed vehicle invulnerability, soul engine power source, ethereal/phasing rules, fear aura, self-repair (possessed), undead crew, hellfire damage type, death sense

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Horror Starter: "The Midnight Express"
**Inspired by:** Every ghost train legend — the phantom locomotive that runs on abandoned tracks, the train that arrives at stations that no longer exist, the engineer who died at the throttle and never let go.

**Setup:** The heroes are passengers on a late-night train that stops at a station that isn't on the map. The doors open. No one boards. The train leaves — but the next station isn't on the map either. The conductor hasn't come through in two hours. The locomotive is a Soul Engine Train, and it's not going where the timetable says.

**Complications:** The train accelerates through a junction that should force a stop. Passengers begin disappearing from rear carriages. A bone chariot runs alongside the tracks — its rider gestures urgently. The heroes reach the locomotive and find no driver. The throttle is jammed open. The boiler pressure gauge reads "SOULS: 7." There were eight passengers.

**Vehicles Used:** Soul Engine Train, Bone Chariot, Death Coach (appears at the final station)

**Variant — "The Hearse Follows":** A Hearse of the Damned has been spotted following one of the heroes for three days. It's always two blocks behind. It's always empty. The engine is always running. Tonight it's one block behind. And the passenger door is open.

### Haunted Vehicles: "The Dutchman's Bargain"
**Inspired by:** The Flying Dutchman legend — a ghost ship doomed to sail forever, offering bargains to the living that always come at a terrible price.

**Setup:** The heroes' vessel is becalmed in fog. A ship materialises — the Flying Dutchman. Its captain offers fair wind and safe passage in exchange for a simple task: deliver a sealed chest to a specific port. The chest must not be opened. The port hasn't existed for two hundred years.

**Complications:** The fog lifts and the heroes' ship is moving again — toward a reef. The sealed chest whispers at night. A cursed submarine surfaces alongside and its crew (undead, silent) point toward the chest. Opening the chest reveals a compass that points to a location underwater. The "port" is beneath the waves. So is the Dutchman's freedom.

**Vehicles Used:** Flying Dutchman, Cursed Submarine, Ghost Ship (the heroes' vessel becomes one if they fail)

**Variant — "Christine's Children":** Three possessed cars in a small town. They were all built in the same factory, in the same month, by the same worker. The worker died on the assembly line. The cars share his rage. Destroying one makes the others stronger.
