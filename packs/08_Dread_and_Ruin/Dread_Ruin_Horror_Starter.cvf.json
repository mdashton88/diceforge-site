      "desc": "A black carriage drawn by spectral horses, arriving uninvited at the homes of the dying. No driver is visible, but the door opens when she stops, and something inside is waiting. She has come for a passenger. She always leaves with one.",
      "notes": "The death coach is your omen and your countdown timer. She appears before a death, which means the players see her and know someone is about to die \u2014 but not who. She can't be stopped by physical means. Destroying her just means she rebuilds herself the next night.",

Her hull is encrusted with barnacles from centuries of drifting, her rigging hangs in tatters, and the lights that flicker in her cabin windows are not lanterns. She approaches other vessels in fog and what happens next depends on what she wants.",
      "notes": "The ghost ship is your maritime horror encounter. She appears from fog, she can't be outrun, and boarding her is a descent into a haunted location that follows nautical logic \u2014 flooded decks, locked cabins, something in the hold. The ship herself is the dungeon.",

      "notes": "The possessed car turns a mundane object into a trap. The players are inside when she comes alive. Steering doesn't respond, brakes don't work, doors are locked.

      "notes": "The soul engine is your vehicle-as-location. The players board the train and can't get off \u2014 the doors are sealed, the windows show impossible landscapes, and the other passengers are hollow-eyed and silent.

      "notes": "The bone chariot is your undead cavalry vehicle. She charges into the living, tramples formations, and the driver fights from the platform with weapons forged from grave iron. Destroying the chariot scatters the bones \u2014 but unless the binding spell is broken, she reassembles by midnight.",

      "notes": "The infernal war machine is your demon vehicle. She ignores conventional damage, passes through solid matter, and her weapons cause supernatural wounds. The players can't fight her conventionally \u2014 they need holy weapons, binding rituals, or the name of the demon that drives her.",

      "notes": "The cursed submarine combines ghost ship horror with submarine claustrophobia. She attacks shipping, then vanishes to the deep. The players must find her wreck, board her, and deal with a crew that doesn't know they're dead \u2014 or doesn't care.",

She's a fairy tale that refused to stay in the book.",
