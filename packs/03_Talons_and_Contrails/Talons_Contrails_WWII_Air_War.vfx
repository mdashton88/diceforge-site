      "notes": "The Spitfire's advantage is manoeuvrability. She out-turns everything she fights, which means she wins at close range. Use her in dogfight scenarios where positioning matters \u2014 the Spitfire pilot wants to get behind the enemy, not outrun them.",

      "notes": "The Mustang's range is her defining advantage. She goes further than any other fighter of the era. Use her for long-range escort missions where fuel management matters. She's also fast enough for ground attack, making her versatile in mixed scenarios.",

      "notes": "The B-17 is your crew vehicle. Ten positions means every player has a role. Damage creates escalating crises \u2014 engine fires, wounded crew, oxygen failure. The chin turret on the G-model finally covers the head-on approach that German fighters exploited on earlier variants.",

She's slow, she's vulnerable to fighters, and in a dive she puts her bombs within thirty feet of the target. The Stuka is precision in an era of approximation.",
      "notes": "The Stuka is devastating against ground targets but helpless against fighters. Her siren is a Fear effect on ground troops.

      "notes": "The Zero is your glass cannon. She out-manoeuvres everything but one good burst sets her on fire. No armour, no self-sealing tanks \u2014 every hit that connects is potentially fatal. Use her to demonstrate the tactical dilemma: she's better than you in a turning fight, so don't turn-fight her. Dive, shoot, and run.",

      "notes": "The Corsair is the American answer to the Zero \u2014 she doesn't out-turn her, she outpaces and out-dives her. Use her for dive-and-zoom tactics rather than turning dogfights. Her ruggedness means she survives hits that would destroy a Zero, which changes the attrition calculus.",

      "notes": "The Lancaster is your night bombing vehicle. She operates in darkness, navigating by radar and pathfinder markers. Night fighter attacks come without warning \u2014 the first sign is cannon shells hitting the fuselage. Use her for tense night missions where the crew can't see what's hunting them.",
