      "notes": "The Phantom is your multi-role player aircraft. Two crew means pilot and weapons officer \u2014 two player roles per aircraft. She carries both air-to-air missiles and bombs, which makes her flexible. Her lack of a gun in early models is historically accurate and creates interesting tactical constraints.",
