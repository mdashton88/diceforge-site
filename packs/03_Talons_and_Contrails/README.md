## .vfx Gaps

Minimal. The WWI Aces pack would benefit from synchronised gun and wing damage specials, but functions perfectly with existing fixed HMG mounts. The supplement adds 3-state dogfight positioning, altitude bands, strafing runs, and wingman tactics.

## One-Sheet Adventures

### WWI — Aces High: "Bloody April"
**Inspired by:** April 1917 — the Royal Flying Corps lost 245 aircraft in a single month. Life expectancy for a new pilot was measured in days. The Albatros D.III ruled the skies and the Red Baron's Jasta 11 was at its peak.

**Setup:** The heroes fly a dawn patrol — three SE.5a fighters escorting an RE.8 observation plane over the lines. The RE.8 must photograph a rail junction. The patrol route crosses known hostile airspace.

**Complications:** Two Albatros D.IIIs bounce them out of the sun. The RE.8's observer is hit — the camera still works, but the rear gun is unmanned. A Fokker Dr.I with distinctive markings joins the fight. The engine of one SE.5a starts trailing smoke. The photographs are vital — breaking off means the infantry assault tomorrow goes in blind.

**Vehicles Used:** SE.5a ×3, RE.8, Albatros D.III ×2, Fokker Dr.I

**Variant — "The Zeppelin Hunt":** Night mission. A Zeppelin L-33 is bombing London. Two Sopwith Camels must climb to 15,000 feet in the dark, find the airship, and bring it down before it reaches the city. The Zeppelin's gunners are waiting.

### WWII — Air War: "The Big Week"
**Inspired by:** Big Week (February 1944) — the concentrated Allied campaign to destroy the Luftwaffe's fighter production. B-17 formations flew deep into Germany with Mustang escort. Losses were savage on both sides.

**Setup:** A box of three B-17G Flying Fortresses must bomb an aircraft factory while two P-51D Mustangs provide escort. The Luftwaffe sends four Bf 109Gs and two Fw 190As to intercept.

**Complications:** The lead B-17's bombardier is killed — who takes over the bomb run? A Fw 190 rams a B-17 deliberately (Sturmgruppe tactics). The Mustangs are low on fuel — escort the bombers home or break off? Flak over the target is intense. One bomber's ball turret is jammed with the gunner inside.

**Vehicles Used:** B-17G ×3, P-51D Mustang ×2, Bf 109G ×3, Fw 190A ×2

**Variant — "The Channel Dash":** Low-level. Spitfire Mk IXs and F4U Corsairs strafe a coastal convoy. Flak ships, Ju 87 Stukas overhead, and the Lancaster bombers are late.

### Vietnam — Air Cav: "Hot LZ"
**Inspired by:** The air mobile assaults of Vietnam — Hueys descending into clearings while door gunners blazed and Cobras worked the treeline. Ia Drang, Hamburger Hill, and a thousand unnamed LZs.

**Setup:** Three UH-1 Hueys carrying infantry must land at a jungle clearing designated LZ Scarlet. One AH-1 Cobra provides gun support. An O-1 Bird Dog is already on station marking targets with smoke.

**Complications:** The LZ is hot — heavy fire from the treeline as the first Huey flares to land. The Bird Dog takes a hit and goes down in the jungle, crew alive. The second wave's CH-47 Chinook carrying ammunition and a 105mm howitzer is 15 minutes out. The Cobra expends its rockets — only the minigun remains. An F-4 Phantom II is available for one napalm pass, but the friendlies are danger close.

**Vehicles Used:** UH-1 Huey ×3, AH-1 Cobra, O-1 Bird Dog, CH-47 Chinook, F-4 Phantom II

**Variant — "Arc Light":** The heroes are a B-52 Stratofortress crew on a carpet bombing mission. The mission is routine until the target coordinates are contested — friendlies may be in the box. An AC-130 Spectre is on station and can verify, but it's taking ground fire.

### Modern Military Air: "Denied Airspace"
**Inspired by:** Modern SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defences) missions — the most dangerous flying in modern warfare. Stealth, electronic warfare, and precision strikes against radar-guided missile systems. Every second counts.

**Setup:** An F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II must neutralise an air defence network protecting a hostile airfield. An MQ-9 Reaper provides initial reconnaissance. Two Eurofighter Typhoons provide backup. The airfield is defended by MiG-29 Fulcrums on alert and a Su-57 Felon on the tarmac.

**Complications:** The Reaper detects a mobile SAM battery not in the intelligence briefing. The F-22's stealth is compromised by an unexpected radar frequency. The Su-57 launches before the airfield can be hit. An AH-64D Apache is available for close air support against the SAM, but it means crossing the engagement zone. A UH-60 Blackhawk carrying a special operations team needs the airfield clear in 30 minutes.

**Vehicles Used:** F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning II, MQ-9 Reaper, Eurofighter Typhoon ×2, AH-64D Apache, MiG-29 Fulcrum, Su-57 Felon

**Variant — "Dustoff":** Peacetime rules of engagement. A CH-47F Chinook medevac mission into a valley under fire. The A-10 Thunderbolt II can suppress, but civilian structures are in the line of fire. Every weapon release needs authorisation.
