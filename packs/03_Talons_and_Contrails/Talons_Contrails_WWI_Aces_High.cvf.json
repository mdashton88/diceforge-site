      "name": "Sopwith Camel",
      "desc": "The most successful fighter of the Great War \u2014 and the most dangerous to its own pilots. The rotary engine's torque makes her turn like lightning to the right and like a drunk to the left. She killed more enemy aircraft than any other Allied type, and more trainee pilots than the Germans did.",
      "notes": "The Camel's torque is a mechanical feature: +1 Handling on right turns, -1 on left. This asymmetry makes dogfights tactical rather than abstract. Experienced pilots exploit it; novices die learning. Perfect for campaigns where pilot skill matters as much as the machine.",

She's slow in level flight but in a turning, climbing dogfight she's nearly untouchable. Every Allied pilot who met one remembered the experience \u2014 if they survived it.",
      "notes": "The Dr.I's advantage is climb rate and turn radius, not speed. She loses in a straight chase but wins any turning fight. Use her for named aces \u2014 the Dr.I is a character aircraft, not a mass-production type. Give the pilot a name, a reputation, and a kill count.",

      "notes": "The SPAD is your energy fighter \u2014 she dives fast, fires, and climbs away. She doesn't turn-fight; she boom-and-zooms. Use her for players who prefer speed over agility. The contrast with the Camel creates interesting tactical choices within a flight.",

      "notes": "The Albatros is your standard German opposition for 1917 campaigns. She's well-balanced \u2014 fast enough to catch, tough enough to survive a burst, and armed well enough to kill in one pass. Use her in formations of four to six for historically accurate Jasta encounters.",

      "notes": "The SE.5a is your reliable alternative to the Camel. She's forgiving for new players \u2014 no torque quirks, good speed, decent armament. The wing-mounted Lewis can be pulled down on a Foster mount to fire upward, which is devastating against enemies above.",

      "notes": "The Nieuport is your early-war fighter. She's outclassed by 1918 but in 1916-17 she's competitive. Use her for campaigns that start early in the war, letting the players feel the technology evolve as better aircraft arrive. The single gun means every burst counts.",

The Zeppelins came and went as they pleased.",
      "notes": "The Zeppelin is your strategic threat and your Gargantuan target. She's enormous, slow, and filled with hydrogen \u2014 one incendiary round and she's a torch. But she flies higher than most fighters can reach. Use her for interception missions where the challenge is getting to altitude before she drops her bombs.",
