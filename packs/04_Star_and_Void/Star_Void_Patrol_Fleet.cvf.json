      "notes": "The scout corvette is your player starting vessel. She's fast, she's agile, and she forces the players to rely on brains over firepower. Every encounter is a decision: observe and report, or engage and risk losing the only eyes the fleet has in this sector.",

      "notes": "The blockade runner is your speed-run vessel. She wins by not fighting \u2014 every encounter is a chase. Her low Toughness means a single hit could be fatal, so the tension is constant. Perfect for smuggling, intelligence, and wartime resupply missions.",

The players can fight from inside a captured freighter, hunt her as patrol crew, or fly her themselves in a piracy campaign. Her weapons are tuned to disable \u2014 she wants the cargo intact.",
