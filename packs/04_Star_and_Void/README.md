## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Sci-Fi Starter Fleet** provides 10 spacecraft using core laser and missile weapons. Scout fighter, light freighter, corvette, assault shuttle, gunboat, blockade runner, destroyer, heavy cruiser, carrier, and armed merchantman. Enough for any GM to run a space encounter tonight.

The **Star & Void supplement** adds crew station actions (helm, weapons, engineering, sensors), shield management, FTL travel frameworks, sensor operations, and fleet-scale combat. The Patrol Fleet, Battle Fleet, and Capital Ships packs then deliver vessels designed to use those systems — from mining vessels with sensor arrays to planet-killing world engines.

## .vfx Gaps

**Spacecraft .vfx:** Spacecraft locomotion type, shield generator mod, FTL drive mod, sensor array mod, tactical relay mod, crew station framework, fleet command rules

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Sci-Fi Starter Fleet: "The Kepler Run"
**Inspired by:** Every smuggler's run in science fiction — the tramp freighter dodging patrols through dangerous space. Universal and timeless.

**Setup:** The heroes' light freighter carries contraband cargo through a system patrolled by two customs cutters and a corvette. The destination is a station on the far side of an asteroid belt.

**Complications:** A customs cutter hails them for inspection. The asteroid belt is denser than the charts show. A pirate raider shadows them through the belt. The cargo turns out to be more valuable — and more dangerous — than the heroes were told. The station isn't answering hails.

**Vehicles Used:** Light Freighter, Corvette, Blockade Runner (pirate), Scout Fighter ×2 (station defence), Armed Merchantman (plot twist)

**Variant — "First Contact":** The freighter's sensors detect something impossible in the asteroid belt. It's not a ship. It's not a rock. It's moving toward them. The corvette escort is suddenly very interested in being somewhere else.

---

### Patrol Fleet: "Quarantine Zone"
**Inspired by:** The mundane reality of space patrol — customs inspection, pirate interdiction, and the long boring watches punctuated by moments of absolute terror.

**Setup:** A scout corvette and system patrol craft are assigned quarantine duty around a mining colony. Nothing comes in, nothing goes out. Day 17. A blockade runner makes a break for it. A mining vessel requests emergency docking. A courier claims diplomatic immunity.

**Variant — "The Derelict":** A science vessel investigating a derelict finds something aboard that shouldn't exist. The customs cutter must decide whether to let it dock at the station.

---

### Battle Fleet: "The Strait of Stars"
**Inspired by:** Every fleet engagement from Trafalgar to Midway, translated to three dimensions. The geometry of space combat — screening forces, carrier operations, torpedo runs.

**Setup:** A task force (heavy cruiser, two destroyers, a fleet carrier with fighter wings) must hold a jump point against an incoming hostile fleet. The enemy has a battlecruiser, an assault transport, and escort frigates. The carrier's fighters are the decisive advantage — if they launch in time.

**Variant — "The Monitor's Last Stand":** A single monitor defends an orbital station against overwhelming force. The station's civilians are evacuating. The monitor cannot retreat. How long can one ship hold?

---

### Capital Ships of the Void: "The Dreadnought Gambit"
**Inspired by:** The great capital ship actions — Jutland, Leyte Gulf, the Death Star trench run. When the biggest guns in the fleet speak, everything else is background noise.

**Setup:** A dreadnought and escort frigate must prevent a siege platform from reaching bombardment range of a colony world. A super dreadnought waits in reserve but arriving it means leaving another system undefended.

**Variant — "The Colony Ship":** A generation colony ship, unarmed and irreplaceable, must cross hostile space. The escort fleet is inadequate. Every engagement risks the one ship that cannot be replaced.
