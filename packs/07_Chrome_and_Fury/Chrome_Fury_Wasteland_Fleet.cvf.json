      "desc": "Eighteen wheels of diesel-powered fury, armoured in salvaged plate, and carrying enough supplies to keep a settlement alive for a month. She's the lifeline of the wasteland \u2014 the beast that runs the trade routes between fortress-towns while every raider gang in the desert tries to stop her.",
      "notes": "The war rig is your campaign centrepiece. She's the thing the players protect, drive, or hunt. A convoy run across hostile wasteland is a self-contained adventure \u2014 the rig moves, the raiders attack, and the players fight from the moving vehicle at highway speed. Pure Fury Road.",

      "notes": "The buzz buggy is your swarm vehicle. One is a nuisance. Eight are a crisis. They surround the war rig, harry the escorts, and the gunners fire from every direction. Use them in packs \u2014 individually fragile, collectively overwhelming.",

      "notes": "The scrap crawler is your all-terrain vehicle. She crosses rubble, sand, and broken ground that the interceptors can't handle. Use her for expeditions into the deep waste where the roads have been gone for decades. Her slow speed means encounters last longer \u2014 no outrunning anything.",

      "notes": "The sand yacht is your silent approach vehicle. She uses no fuel, which means she can operate indefinitely.
