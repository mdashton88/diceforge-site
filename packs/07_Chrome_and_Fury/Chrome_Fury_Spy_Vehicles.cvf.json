      "notes": "The spy car is pure Bond fantasy. Every modification is a gadget the players can trigger once \u2014 machine guns, oil slick, smoke screen, ejector seat. Build a chase where they need to use each gadget at the right moment. Once they're spent, the car is just a very expensive sedan.",

      "notes": "The stealth bike is your insertion vehicle. Silent approach, minimal signature, and fast extraction. Use her for covert missions where the players need to reach a location undetected. She can't fight, but if she's fighting, the mission has already failed.",

She then drives up the beach and continues as if nothing unusual happened. Because in this line of work, it hasn't.",
      "notes": "The submersible car is your ultimate spy gadget. She transitions from road to water seamlessly, which means escape routes nobody expects. Use her for the dramatic moment \u2014 pursued to the coast, the players drive off the cliff and disappear beneath the waves.",

      "notes": "The surveillance van is your mission control. She's where the players plan, monitor, and coordinate. The tension is the stakeout \u2014 hours of watching, then sudden action when the target moves. She's also vulnerable: if the enemy finds the van, the entire operation is blown.",

She's the personal aircraft for agents who need to be somewhere the roads don't go.",

      "notes": "The jet pack is your one-use escape tool. Thirty seconds of flight \u2014 that's five rounds. The players need to plan exactly when to use it and where to land. It's the extraction method when every other option has failed. Spectacular, brief, and unrepeatable.",
