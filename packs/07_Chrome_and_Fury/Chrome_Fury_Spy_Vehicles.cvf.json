      "notes": "The spy car is your Bond vehicle. Each gadget is a one-use ability \u2014 the oil slick, the smoke screen, the tyre shredders. Once used, they're gone. The drama is choosing when to deploy them. Use her for espionage campaigns that embrace the genre.",

      "notes": "The stealth bike is your infiltration vehicle. Silent approach, small profile, and fast extraction. Use her for missions where the player needs to reach the target undetected. Her electric drive means no engine noise, but she has limited range.",
