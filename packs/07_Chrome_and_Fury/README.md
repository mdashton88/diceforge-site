The **Chrome & Fury supplement** adds ram and sideswipe mechanics, gadget modification slots (oil slick, smoke screen, spike strip, ejector seat), convoy formation rules, train combat, and extended multi-round chase frameworks. The Wasteland Fleet and Spy Vehicles packs deliver vehicles designed to exploit those systems.

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Chase Starter: "The Autobahn Express"
**Inspired by:** Every great car chase ever filmed — the tunnel chase, the bridge jump, the wrong-way freeway. The geometry of pursuit at speed. Cars are weapons when driven with sufficient intent.

**Setup:** The heroes must escort an armoured SUV carrying a witness from a safehouse to a courthouse 80 miles away. The opposition has a pursuit muscle car, two pursuit bikes, and a helicopter coordinating from above. The witness testifies in two hours. The highway between here and there runs through three tunnels and crosses one bridge.

**Complications:** A construction zone funnels traffic to one lane. The helicopter drops a spike strip from a bridge overpass. One of the pursuit bikes is actually an undercover ally — but which one? The armoured SUV takes a tyre hit and starts pulling left. A getaway van blocks the courthouse entrance.

**Vehicles Used:** Armoured SUV, Pursuit Muscle Car, Pursuit Bike ×2, Pursuit Helicopter, Getaway Van, Police Interceptor (reinforcement)

**Variant — "The Monaco Switch":** The witness isn't in the armoured SUV — they're in the sports coupe three cars back. The SUV is a decoy. The opposition doesn't know. Yet.

### Wasteland Fleet: "The Fury Road"
**Inspired by:** The universal post-apocalyptic convoy — a column of survivors crossing hostile territory with everything they own. The fuel is running low. The war parties are circling. The destination might not exist.

**Setup:** A war rig hauling a fuel tanker leads a convoy (thunder bus full of settlers, two buzz buggies as outriders, a scrap crawler carrying tools) across 200 miles of wasteland to a rumoured settlement. A rival war party wants the fuel.

**Complications:** A sandstorm forces the convoy into a canyon — perfect ambush territory. The fuel tanker springs a leak. A death bike rider approaches under a white flag — they want to trade information for passage. The thunder bus overheats. The settlement exists, but it's already under siege by a convoy fortress.

**Vehicles Used:** War Rig, Fuel Tanker, Thunder Bus, Buzz Buggy ×2, Scrap Crawler, Death Bike, Convoy Fortress

**Variant — "The Sand Yacht Escape":** No fuel. No engines. Three sand yachts must outrun motorised pursuers across a salt flat using only wind. Speed versus manoeuvrability. The wind is shifting.

### Spy Vehicles: "The Riviera Job"
**Inspired by:** The classic spy car chase — winding coastal roads, hidden weapons, gadgets deployed at the perfect moment. A tuxedo behind the wheel and a deadline that won't wait.

**Setup:** The heroes must retrieve a data drive from a moving armoured limo travelling a coastal highway. They have a spy car, a stealth motorcycle, and a gyrocopter for overwatch. The limo's security detail includes two armoured SUVs and a pursuit helicopter.

**Complications:** The coastal road narrows to single-track through a cliff tunnel. The limo is heading for a private yacht — once it's aboard, it's in international waters. The gyrocopter's fuel is limited. The spy car's concealed weapons jam after one use. The data drive is booby-trapped. A submersible car surfaces alongside the yacht — friend or foe?

**Vehicles Used:** Spy Car (Classic), Stealth Motorcycle, Gyrocopter, Armoured Limo, Armed Speedboat, Submersible Car

**Variant — "Q-Branch Field Test":** The Q-Branch Special is loaded with experimental gadgets. Each one works once. Maybe. The heroes must test them all in a single pursuit through a European capital. The opposition doesn't know about the gadgets. Neither, entirely, do the heroes.
