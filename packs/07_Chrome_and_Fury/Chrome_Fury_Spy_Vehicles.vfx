      "notes": "The spy car is your signature espionage vehicle. Her gadgets are the fun \u2014 each one is a single-use surprise that changes a chase or combat encounter. Machine guns, smoke screen, oil slick, ejector seat. Track them as expendable resources. Once used, they're gone until Q-Branch restocks.",
