Her shallow draft lets her run into coastal waters where heavier pursuers cannot follow \u2014 and that's saved more pirate crews than any amount of cannon fire.",
      "notes": "The sloop is your glass cannon. She can't slug it out with a frigate, but she shouldn't need to. Use her in chases, boarding actions, and ambushes where her Handling advantage matters. A sloop captain who stands and fights has already lost.",

Use her when the party needs to siege a coastal fort, or when the enemy brings one against the party's harbour. The mortars are terrifying but she's nearly helpless in a ship-to-ship fight.",

      "notes": "The man-o'-war is your campaign finale or your impossible obstacle. She should never appear casually. If she's on the horizon, something enormous is happening \u2014 a full-scale invasion, a royal visit, or the final battle of a war. You don't fight a man-o'-war. You survive one.",
