      "notes": "The Fletcher is your player vessel for a Pacific campaign. She's fast, well-armed, and small enough that every crew member matters. A destroyer crew of three hundred feels intimate compared to a battleship's two thousand. The captain knows everyone's name. That makes it personal when someone dies.",

She's also a massive target that the enemy wants to sink, creating constant tension between offensive missions and keeping their floating home alive.",

Run submarine combat as a tension exercise \u2014 the enemy destroyer is overhead, pinging sonar, and the players have to stay silent and pray. Use Dramatic Task rules for silent running.",

She can't take a hit, so every attack is an all-or-nothing gamble. Perfect for one-shot adventures where the players have one chance to sink a capital ship and then run like hell.",

She's loose in the Atlantic, the convoys are defenceless, and the players' destroyer group has to find her, shadow her, and survive long enough for the battleships to arrive.
