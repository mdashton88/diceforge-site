## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Naval Starter** provides 10 generic warships (patrol boat through battleship) armed with existing modern weapons — torpedoes, autocannons, HMGs. These let GMs run naval encounters tonight.

The **Blood & Thunder supplement** adds broadside arc mechanics, boarding actions, weather gauge, crew quality ratings, and submarine warfare rules. The four full expansion packs then deliver historically accurate fleets with period-appropriate weapons — from Age of Sail broadsides to WWII torpedo runs.

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Naval Starter: "Blockade Run"
**Inspired by:** The real cat-and-mouse of naval blockade breaking — Napoleonic runners, Civil War blockade runners, WWII convoy escorts. A universal naval premise that works in any era.

**Setup:** The heroes must escort a vital cargo ship through a strait patrolled by three enemy corvettes and a destroyer. The cargo ship is slow and unarmed. The escort force is whatever the party has — ideally a destroyer and two patrol boats from the Starter pack.

**Complications:** Fog rolls in at the worst moment. A submarine contact appears on the approach. The cargo ship's engine fails at the narrowest point of the strait. One of the corvettes is actually a disguised heavy cruiser.

**Vehicles Used:** Destroyer, Corvette, Patrol Boat, Cargo Ship (reskinned Convoy Truck stats), Submarine

**Variant — "The Pirate's Toll":** Fantasy reskin. Sky-pirates blockade a cloud strait. The cargo is a diplomatic envoy. The corsairs want ransom, not blood — but the envoy carries a secret worth killing for.

### Age of Sail Fleet: "The Treasure Convoy"
**Inspired by:** The Spanish treasure fleets — galleons laden with New World gold running the gauntlet home through privateer-infested waters. Drake, Raleigh, and a hundred unnamed corsairs made their fortunes here.

**Setup:** A convoy of three galleons and an East Indiaman escort carries a fortune in spices and silver across open ocean. The heroes are either defending the convoy or attacking it — the one-sheet works both ways.

**Complications:** A storm scatters the convoy on the second day. One galleon signals distress — genuine or a trap? A 5th-rate frigate from a neutral power "observes" the battle, and may intervene if provoked. The East Indiaman's captain has been bribed.

**Vehicles Used:** Galleon, East Indiaman, Sloop, Brigantine, 5th-Rate Frigate

**Variant — "Letters of Marque":** The heroes are freshly commissioned privateers with a single sloop. Their first target is supposed to be a merchant brigantine, but it's actually escorting something far more valuable — and far more dangerous.

---

### Viking Raiders: "The Monastery Shore"
**Inspired by:** The Lindisfarne raid (793 AD) and the great Viking raids on coastal monasteries. The longships appear at dawn, the monks ring the bell, and everything changes.

**Setup:** Three longships approach a coastal settlement at dawn. The heroes can be the raiders (seeking a specific relic the jarl demands), the defenders (a small garrison with one cog and local militia), or a third party (a merchant knarr caught in the wrong harbour at the wrong time).

**Complications:** The monastery has a hidden underground passage to a clifftop signal beacon. A Byzantine chelandion with Greek fire is three hours away — if the beacon is lit. The relic the jarl wants is cursed. One of the longship captains plans to betray the others and keep the treasure.

**Vehicles Used:** Longship (Drekar), Snekkja, Knarr, Cog, Byzantine Chelandion

**Variant — "The River Kingdoms":** Shift inland. The longships navigate a river system to raid a fortified trading post. Shallow water, bridge ambushes, and a pursuing war-skeid make the retreat as dangerous as the raid.

### Napoleonic Navy: "The Cutting-Out Expedition"
**Inspired by:** The countless cutting-out expeditions of the Napoleonic Wars — small boat actions where a ship's crew in longboats would capture enemy vessels at anchor under cover of darkness. Cochrane's exploits are the gold standard.

**Setup:** An enemy frigate lies at anchor in a fortified harbour. The heroes' captain cannot engage the shore batteries directly. Instead, a cutting-out party in two ship's longboats must row into the harbour at night, board the frigate, cut her cables, and sail her out under fire.

**Complications:** The harbour chain is up — someone must land and cut it. The frigate has a skeleton crew, but they're alert. A brig-sloop at the harbour mouth starts its patrol early. The wind drops, leaving the stolen frigate becalmed under the guns of the fort.

**Vehicles Used:** Ship's Longboat ×2, 5th-Rate Frigate, Brig-Sloop, Gunboat

**Variant — "The Bomb Vessel":** Instead of stealing a ship, the heroes must position a bomb vessel for shore bombardment while under fire from gunboats. The mortar crew needs three rounds to range in. The gunboats arrive in two.

### WWII Naval: "Convoy PQ-17"
**Inspired by:** The Arctic convoys — the most dangerous supply run of the war. PQ-17's scattering order is one of the great naval tragedies, but any Arctic convoy delivers the same tension: U-boats below, bombers above, ice everywhere.

**Setup:** An Allied convoy of Liberty Ships escorted by a Flower-class corvette and a Fletcher-class destroyer must transit through U-boat-infested waters. Intelligence reports at least two Type VII U-boats in the patrol area. Air cover is intermittent.

**Complications:** Sonar contact at dusk — real or a thermal layer? One Liberty Ship falls behind with engine trouble. A wolf pack signal is intercepted — three boats, not two. Fog rolls in, and the convoy must choose between tight formation (collision risk) or spread formation (easier pickings for torpedoes). An E-boat flotilla approaches from the coast.

**Vehicles Used:** Fletcher-class Destroyer, Flower-class Corvette, Liberty Ship, Type VII U-Boat ×2, S-Boot (E-Boat)

**Variant — "PT Boat Alley":** Pacific theatre. PT boats ambush a Japanese convoy in a narrow strait at night. Searchlights, torpedoes, and the terrifying moment when the destroyer turns toward you.
