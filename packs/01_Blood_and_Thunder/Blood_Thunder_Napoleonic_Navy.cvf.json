      "desc": "One hundred and four guns across three decks, crewed by over eight hundred men, and the most powerful warship afloat. She is the flagship, the floating command post, the vessel that anchors the centre of the line and absorbs punishment that would break lesser ships. Her sides are oak three feet thick at the waterline.",
      "notes": "The 1st rate is a set-piece, not a random encounter. She appears at Trafalgar, at the Nile, at Copenhagen \u2014 the decisive fleet actions where empires are won and lost. If the players are aboard, they're in the middle of history. If she's the enemy, they need a plan that doesn't involve standing in front of her guns.",

She's too small for fleet actions but perfect for coastal adventures \u2014 hunting smugglers, intercepting dispatches, blockade running, and single-ship duels with enemy corvettes.
