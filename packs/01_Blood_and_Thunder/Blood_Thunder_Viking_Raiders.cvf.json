      "name": "Longship (Drekar)",
      "desc": "The quintessential Viking warship. Long, narrow, shallow-drafted, and terrifyingly fast for its era. Built to cross the North Atlantic and then sail up rivers to strike where no one expects. The dragon prow isn't decoration \u2014 it's a statement of intent.",
      "notes": "The longship's defining advantage is Shallow Draft. She goes where deeper vessels cannot follow \u2014 up rivers, into estuaries, onto beaches. Build encounters around this mobility. The Vikings don't fight fair; they appear where they shouldn't be, strike hard, and vanish before the local lord can muster a response.",

      "notes": "The snekkja is your ambush predator. Use two or three together for a wolf-pack raid. Individually they're fragile, but their speed means the players have to catch them before they scatter \u2014 and each one runs in a different direction.",

She's too valuable to risk on casual raids \u2014 the skeid sails when the entire war-fleet sails, and her presence means someone is serious about conquest rather than plunder.",
      "notes": "The skeid signals escalation. When one appears, the stakes have risen from 'raiders hit a village' to 'an invasion fleet has arrived.' Use her as the flagship of an NPC war-leader the players need to stop, board, or negotiate with. Her crew is enormous and well-armed.",

      "notes": "The knarr is your escort mission. She carries something irreplaceable \u2014 settlers, tribute, sacred relics, or the jarl's family \u2014 and she's slow enough that every enemy vessel on the sea can catch her. The players protect her, and every encounter is a desperate rearguard action.",

      "notes": "Greek fire is terrifying and should be treated as such. The flame projector uses the Cone Template and ignores Waterborne protection. Wooden longships burn beautifully. Use the chelandion as the reason the Vikings don't just sail into Constantinople \u2014 they tried once, and the survivors never forgot.",

      "notes": "The dhow represents the wider world beyond the Viking theatre. Use her to remind the players that the Norse weren't the only seafarers of the age. An encounter with a dhow means exotic cargo, unfamiliar fighting techniques, and trade routes that lead to adventures far from Scandinavia.",

      "notes": "The Norman ship is a landing craft. She delivers a cavalry charge onto a beach, which is one of the most dramatic tactical images in medieval warfare. Use her for invasion scenarios where the players must either stop the landing or participate in it. The horses panicking in the hold during rough weather is a complication that writes itself.",

      "desc": "Logs lashed together, soaked in pitch, set alight, and pushed toward the enemy anchorage on the current. It's not sophisticated. It doesn't need to be. A wall of fire drifting toward your moored ships at night will break the nerve of any fleet.",
      "notes": "The fire raft is the medieval fire ship \u2014 cheaper, cruder, and surprisingly effective. Use it as a desperate defensive measure when the players' settlement is attacked by a superior fleet. Someone has to build the rafts, time the tide, and light them without being spotted.",

      "notes": "The cog is your trading vessel. The players either own one, protect one, or rob one. Her high sides give defenders a bonus against boarders, which means a cog with a determined crew is much harder to take than it looks. Merchants in this era aren't helpless \u2014 they're armed and experienced.",

      "notes": "The currach is your stealth insertion vehicle. She's invisible against a dark coastline, draws almost no water, and can be portaged overland. Use her for infiltration, scouting, or escape \u2014 the players abandon their longship to pursue someone up a river too shallow for the drekar, and the only vessel that fits is this ridiculous little hide boat.",
