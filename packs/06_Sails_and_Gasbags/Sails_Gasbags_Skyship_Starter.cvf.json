      "desc": "A rowing boat that flies. Open-topped, wind-blasted, and carrying two to four crew who hang on with white knuckles. She's the dinghy of the sky \u2014 small enough to dock on a rooftop, fast enough to outrun a galleon, and fragile enough that a crossbow bolt through the levitation crystal ends the conversation permanently.",
      "notes": "The sky skiff is your starter vessel and your ship's boat. She scouts, she ferries, and she provides the dramatic moment when the players leap from the mother ship in a skiff to board the enemy. One hit to the levitation system and she's falling, not flying.",
