      "notes": "The sky cutter is your fast transport and courier vessel. She's too small for serious combat but she outpaces everything in the sky. Use her for time-critical deliveries, messenger interception, and the opening scene where the players arrive somewhere in a hurry.",

      "notes": "The cloud galleon is your prize and your employer. The players protect one, rob one, or crew one. Her cargo is the adventure hook \u2014 whatever she's carrying, someone wants it badly enough to attack a ship this size. The captain is always interesting, always pragmatic.",

She's ugly, she's loud, and she's nearly indestructible.",
      "notes": "The dwarven ironclad is your unstoppable force. She ignores attacks that cripple wooden ships. Her weakness is fuel \u2014 she burns coal and needs regular resupply. Strand her far from a dwarven port and she's a sitting duck. Use logistics as the counter to her invulnerability.",

She flies a black flag and everyone who sees it makes a quick calculation about whether running or surrendering costs less.",
      "notes": "The pirate sky-brig is your recurring antagonist. She appears, demands cargo, and the players decide whether to fight, negotiate, or surrender. Her crew are colourful, her captain is memorable, and she always escapes the first encounter to come back later. Pirates are adventure generators.",
