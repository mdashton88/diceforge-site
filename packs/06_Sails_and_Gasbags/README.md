## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Skyship Starter** provides 10 airships with HMGs, bombs, and autocannons — skiff, cloud cutter, sky brig, war galleon, dwarven ironclad, observation balloon, transport barge, elven windrunner, bomber dirigible, and royal flagship.

The **Sails & Gasbags supplement** adds gas cell vulnerability, buoyancy mechanics, altitude bands with weather effects, and aerial boarding rules. The Fantasy Skyfleet pack delivers vessels designed for those systems — goblin balloon bombs, dragon-rider platforms, and pirate sky-brigs with grappling hooks.

## .vfx Gaps

**Skyship .vfx:** Gas cell vulnerability, buoyancy/lift mod, altitude band framework, aerial boarding rules, rigging damage, living mount integration (dragon-rider platform), unreliable flight (goblin balloon bomb)

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Skyship Starter: "The Cloud Strait Ambush"
**Inspired by:** Every pirate ambush in every strait in history — the Barbary corsairs, the Malacca pirates, the buccaneers of the Caribbean — transposed into three-dimensional airspace.

**Setup:** The heroes' sky brig escorts a transport barge through a cloud strait known for corsair activity. A cloud cutter shadows them from the mist. The barge carries a diplomat whose arrival at the cloud city will change the balance of power.

**Complications:** A second pirate vessel — a war galleon — emerges from a cloud bank ahead. The diplomat has a price on their head from three separate factions. The dwarven ironclad that was supposed to meet them at the far end of the strait is late. A storm front is closing the strait behind them.

**Vehicles Used:** Sky Brig, Transport Barge, Cloud Cutter (pirate), War Galleon (pirate), Dwarven Ironclad (reinforcement), Elven Windrunner (neutral observer)

**Variant — "The Goblin Raid":** Three goblin balloon bombs drift toward a city. They're crude, unreliable, and packed with alchemist's fire. Sky skiffs must intercept them before they reach the market district. The goblins are expendable. The fire isn't.
