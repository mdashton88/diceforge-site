## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Wasteland Starter** provides 10 post-apocalyptic vehicles with salvaged firearms — survivor pickup, war rig, interceptor, death bike, scrap crawler, buzz buggy, thunder bus, sand yacht, fuel tanker, and Frankenstein APC.

The **Rust & Ruin supplement** adds fuel-as-currency mechanics (every mile costs), jury-rig construction rules (build vehicles from scrap), breakdown and reliability tables, wasteland hazard encounters, and salvage operation frameworks. The Wasteland Survivors pack delivers vehicles built around unreliability and desperation — pedal carts, scrap walkers, and river barges held together with wire and hope.

**Wasteland .vfx:** Jury-rig construction framework, breakdown/reliability tables, fuel-as-currency economy, explosive cargo rules, scavenger/salvage rules, ram bonus mod

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Wasteland Starter: "The Last Tanker"
**Inspired by:** The universal post-apocalyptic premise — fuel is life, and someone has the last of it. Convoys, ambushes, desperate alliances, and the mathematics of survival when every gallon counts.

**Setup:** A fuel tanker sits abandoned at a crossroads, engine dead. Two factions converge on it simultaneously — the heroes' settlement (war rig, two buzz buggies) and a raider war party (interceptor, three death bikes, thunder bus). The tanker holds enough fuel to keep one settlement running for three months. There's no sharing.

**Complications:** The tanker isn't abandoned — the driver is hiding underneath with a dead-man switch wired to the fuel. A scrap crawler approaches from the east — a third faction nobody expected. The interceptor's driver offers a deal: half the fuel for safe passage. A sandstorm is two hours out. The tanker's fuel has been contaminated — it works, but it'll wreck any engine within a week.

**Vehicles Used:** Fuel Tanker, War Rig, Buzz Buggy ×2, Interceptor, Death Bike ×3, Thunder Bus, Scrap Crawler

**Variant — "The Wind Road":** No fuel exists. Three sand yachts carry a settlement's seed stock across a salt flat to fertile ground. The wind is the only engine. Raiders on death bikes patrol the flat's edge. The question isn't if they'll be spotted — it's whether the wind holds.
