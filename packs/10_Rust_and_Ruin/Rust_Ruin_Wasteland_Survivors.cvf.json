      "notes": "The salvage truck creates expedition adventures. The players take her to a ruin, find what they need, and haul it back before the raiders arrive. She's slow and valuable \u2014 the perfect escort target.",

      "notes": "The armoured schoolbus is your civilian transport. She carries non-combatants \u2014 which means the stakes are personal. The players protect children, which changes the moral calculus of every combat decision.",

      "notes": "The armoured barge is your water trade vehicle. She follows the river \u2014 she can't go anywhere else \u2014 which makes ambush points predictable. River encounters are constrained by the banks, bridges, and shallows. She's a floating supply run.",
