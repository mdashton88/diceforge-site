      "notes": "The salvage truck is your scavenging vehicle. She creates post-battle scenarios \u2014 the fight's over, now recover what's useful before the next warband arrives. She's a mobile workshop that can repair other vehicles in the field.",

      "notes": "The water tanker is your survival vehicle. She's even more valuable than the fuel tanker because humans can't go three days without water. Use her for community survival campaigns where the players protect the water supply.",

      "notes": "The jury-rig bike is your everyman vehicle. She's cheap, unreliable, and available. She breaks down more often than a proper bike, requiring Repair checks after hard use. But she's repairable with junk and she gets a scout where they need to be.",

      "notes": "The armoured schoolbus is your community vehicle with emotional weight. She carries children to the sheltered area and fighters to the battle. Use her to remind players what they're fighting for. Losing the bus means the community lost its ability to protect its future.",

      "notes": "The sail cart represents the bottom rung of wasteland transport. She's free to operate but dependent on wind. Use her for the most desperate communities \u2014 the ones who have nothing but ingenuity. She's a contrast vehicle that makes the war rigs look like luxury.",

      "notes": "The scrap walker is your wasteland mech. She's crude, unreliable, and terrifying. She represents the peak of wasteland engineering \u2014 a walking vehicle built by geniuses with nothing.
