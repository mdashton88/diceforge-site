      "notes": "The salvage truck is your resource-gathering vehicle. She goes into dangerous ruins and returns with the components the settlement needs. Escort her in, protect the crew while they work, escort her out. Every run is an adventure.",

      "notes": "The water tanker is the fuel tanker's gentler sister. She's just as valuable, just as targeted, but her cargo saves lives rather than powers machines. Use her for the moral dimension \u2014 the players can sell the water or give it away, and the choice defines what kind of survivors they are.",

      "notes": "The jury-rig motorcycle is your disposable scout vehicle. She's unreliable but available. Roll Repair when she's pushed hard. She breaks down at the worst possible moment, which is dramatic and historically accurate for improvised vehicles.",

      "notes": "The armoured schoolbus is the thunder bus variant with more personality. The children's drawings are a detail that makes the vehicle human. She's a mobile home for displaced people, and the players protect her because what she represents \u2014 community, innocence, hope \u2014 matters.",

      "notes": "The river barge is your waterway transport. Rivers are safer than roads in the wasteland because they're harder to ambush. Use her for river trade campaigns where the settlements along the waterway depend on the barge's regular route.",

      "notes": "The pedal cart is the vehicle of absolute poverty. She represents communities with no fuel, no animals, and no resources except human muscles. Use her to show the bottom of the wasteland hierarchy \u2014 and to demonstrate that even the poorest survivors refuse to stop moving.",
