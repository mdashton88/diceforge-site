      "desc": "Bred for war over generations \u2014 bigger, stronger, and meaner than any riding horse. She charges into spear walls without flinching, kicks and bites in close combat, and her rider fights from a platform that towers over infantry. She's the original battle tank.",
      "notes": "The warhorse is your baseline mount. She charges, she tramples, and she gives the rider a height advantage in melee. Her morale is trained \u2014 she doesn't bolt at loud noises or the smell of blood. Compare all fantasy mounts against her to establish relative scale.",

Her tail sting adds a venomous attack that the rider doesn't control \u2014 she stings what she wants. Use her for flying cavalry that's cheaper than griffins.",
