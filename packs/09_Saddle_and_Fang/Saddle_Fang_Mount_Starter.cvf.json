      "name": "Warhorse",
      "desc": "Bred for battle, trained to charge into spear walls without flinching, and heavy enough to knock an armoured man flat. The warhorse is the foundation of cavalry warfare \u2014 without her, knights are just expensive infantry.",
      "notes": "The warhorse is your baseline mount. She provides Pace, charge bonuses, and an elevated fighting position. She also panics under fire, throws riders, and dies to a lucky spear thrust \u2014 all of which create dramatic moments. Losing a warhorse mid-battle changes everything.",

She's not a mount \u2014 she's a partner who tolerates being ridden because the arrangement suits her purposes. She has opinions about where she flies and they don't always align with the rider's.",
      "notes": "The giant eagle is your aerial mount with personality. She's smart enough to refuse stupid orders, which means the player doesn't always get to choose the approach vector. Her talons are weapons in their own right \u2014 she fights alongside the rider, not just under them.",

      "notes": "The griffin combines ground and air capability. She fights on the ground with lion claws and in the air with eagle speed. The bonding mechanic is the hook \u2014 she won't accept another rider, which means if the player dies, the griffin is lost to the party.",

      "notes": "The young dragon is your prestige mount. She's powerful but wilful \u2014 Spirit checks to control her in stressful situations. A dragon that decides to chase prey instead of following orders creates chaos that's entirely in keeping with the source material. She's an ally, not a tool.",

      "notes": "The dire wolf is your ground-based predator mount. She tracks by scent, fights with bite attacks, and her pack instincts mean multiple dire wolves coordinate automatically. Use her for ranger and barbarian characters who want a mount that feels wild rather than domesticated.",

      "notes": "The wyvern is your budget flying mount. She's easier to acquire than a dragon but harder to control \u2014 less intelligent means less reasoning and more animal instinct. The tail stinger adds a poison attack that the rider can direct. She's volatile and rewarding in equal measure.",

      "notes": "The war elephant is your mobile platform. The howdah carries multiple characters \u2014 a mahout, archers, a commander. She's devastating on the charge but her morale is her weakness. Loud noises, fire, and pain can trigger a stampede that hurts allies as much as enemies.",

      "notes": "The giant spider goes where nothing else can \u2014 vertical surfaces, ceilings, narrow passages. She's the drow mount, the underdark scout, and the nightmare of anyone with arachnophobia at the table. Her webbing is a utility tool as much as a weapon.",

      "notes": "The triceratops is your living battering ram. Her charge attack is devastating \u2014 she hits like a vehicle collision because she essentially is one. The frill provides natural armour that covers the rider from frontal attacks. Use her for shock assault and fortification breaching.",

      "notes": "The pegasus is your noble flying mount. She's fast, she's elegant, and she's morally selective \u2014 she won't carry evil characters, which creates interesting party dynamics. Her flight is silent, making her an excellent scout mount. She fights reluctantly, preferring flight over combat.",
