      "name": "Warhorse (Destrier)",
      "desc": "The great warhorse of the heavy cavalry \u2014 seventeen hands, bred for bulk and aggression, trained to bite, kick, and trample. A knight on a destrier is an armoured lance moving at thirty miles an hour. The horse is half the weapon system.",
      "notes": "The destrier is your heavy cavalry mount. She's slower than a light horse but hits like a battering ram on the charge. The rider's lance damage adds the mount's running die. She's expensive, rare, and too valuable to risk on anything that isn't a proper battle.",

      "name": "Giant Eagle",
      "desc": "Intelligent, proud, and capable of carrying a rider across mountain ranges that ground travel can't cross. She hunts independently, she communicates in gestures and cries that her rider learns to read, and she mates for life \u2014 with another eagle, fortunately.",
      "notes": "The giant eagle is your intelligent aerial mount. She understands complex commands and exercises judgement. She won't dive into a situation she considers suicidal, which is a feature, not a bug \u2014 her survival instinct keeps reckless riders alive.",

      "name": "Griffin",
      "desc": "Fierce, loyal, and possessed of a killing instinct that applies to anything smaller than herself \u2014 which is most things. She bonds with a single rider through a ritual that involves fresh meat and considerable personal risk. Once bonded, she's loyal unto death.",
      "notes": "The griffin bonds permanently. She's a character, not equipment \u2014 she has personality, preferences, and emotional responses. Losing a bonded griffin is losing a companion. Use her relationship with the rider as a story element, not just a mobility upgrade.",

      "name": "Dragon (Young)",
      "desc": "Barely fifty years old and already arrogant enough for ten lifetimes. She breathes fire because she can, she flies because walking is beneath her, and she tolerates a rider because the rider is occasionally useful and always entertaining.",
      "notes": "The young dragon is a character who happens to be a mount. She has goals, opinions, and a treasure hoard that's just getting started. The rider-dragon relationship is a negotiation, not a command structure. She's the most powerful mount available and the most difficult to manage.",

      "desc": "The alpha predator of the deep forest. She runs in silence, she tracks by scent across days-old trails, and her jaws close with enough force to sever a limb. She's loyal to her pack, and if the rider earns that loyalty, they're pack.",
      "notes": "The giant wolf is your ranger's mount. She provides tracking, stealth, and ground combat capability in terrain where horses struggle. She fights alongside the rider rather than just carrying them. Use Pack tactics \u2014 she flanks, she harries, she drives prey toward the rider.",

      "desc": "Wings of white feathers spanning twenty feet, the body of a thoroughbred, and an intelligence that understands heroism in a way that animals shouldn't be able to. She descends from the sky when a worthy rider calls, and she leaves when the rider stops being worthy.",
      "notes": "The pegasus is your moral compass mount. She abandons riders who commit evil acts \u2014 and when your flying horse leaves mid-flight, the feedback is immediate and vertical. Use her as a narrative tool that enforces heroic behaviour through consequences.",

      "desc": "Eight legs of chitin-plated muscle, spinnerets that produce silk stronger than steel cable, and multifaceted eyes that see in total darkness. She's the mount of the underdark \u2014 silent, vertical, and profoundly unsettling to surface dwellers.",
      "notes": "The giant spider provides wall-climbing, web-spinning, and darkvision. She's the ultimate dungeon mount \u2014 she goes where horses can't, sees where torches don't reach, and creates barriers that block pursuit. Her appearance is a social disadvantage on the surface.",

      "notes": "The nightmare is your villain's mount. She's dramatic, terrifying, and unmistakably evil. Her hooves set fire to whatever she treads on, her breath is smoke, and her presence triggers Fear checks in animals. Use her for the enemy champion, the death knight, or any antagonist who deserves a dramatic entrance.",

      "desc": "A thousand pounds of muscle, tusk, and bad temper. She charges through undergrowth that stops horses, she roots through barricades like they're made of paper, and she fights with a ferocity that suggests she takes everything personally.",
      "notes": "The giant boar is your aggressive ground mount. She's slower than a horse on open ground but unstoppable in close terrain \u2014 forests, undergrowth, and fortifications. Her tusks gore on the charge and she's resistant to being stopped by anything short of a wall.",

      "desc": "The front half of an eagle, the back half of a horse, and the temperament of something that's trying to decide whether to eat you or let you ride. She's easier to train than a griffin and more common, which makes her the aerial mount of choice for military forces that need numbers.",
      "notes": "The hippogriff is your standard-issue flying mount for aerial cavalry. She's less individual than a griffin \u2014 she can be trained in batches and deployed in formations. Use her for military campaigns where the players command a wing of hippogriff riders rather than a single unique beast.",
