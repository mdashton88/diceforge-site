      "desc": "Forty feet of apex predator with jaws that can bite a horse in half. She doesn't carry a rider comfortably \u2014 she tolerates one because the tiny warm-blooded thing on her neck sometimes points at food. She is the most terrifying living weapon on any battlefield and she knows it.",
      "notes": "The T. Rex is your ultimate ground mount and your most uncontrollable. She has her own hunting instincts and she may ignore the rider to chase prey. Riding check every round in combat. She's devastating when she cooperates and catastrophic when she doesn't.",

      "notes": "The triceratops is your armoured cavalry mount. Her frill provides Cover, her charge is devastating, and she's temperamentally stable compared to predator mounts. She's the reliable choice for dinosaur cavalry \u2014 predictable, powerful, and nearly indestructible from the front.",

Their rider doesn't sit on them \u2014 they run alongside, directing the pack with whistles and gestures.",
      "notes": "The raptor pack is your swarm mount. The rider commands six individual attackers that flank, harass, and overwhelm. Each raptor is fragile but the pack is resilient \u2014 losing one doesn't stop the pack. Use Gang Up bonuses for coordinated attacks.",

      "notes": "The ankylosaurus is your mobile bunker. She's nearly immune to conventional weapons from every direction. Her tail club is her only offensive weapon but it's devastating. Use her for defensive operations \u2014 she holds positions and absorbs attacks that would kill anything else.",

      "notes": "The brontosaurus is your mobile platform. She carries a howdah with multiple crew positions \u2014 archers, lookouts, command post. She doesn't fight directly but her tail sweep is an area attack and her sheer mass makes her an impassable obstacle. Use her as a mobile base rather than a weapon.",

      "notes": "The carnotaurus is your pursuit predator mount. She's faster than a T. Rex, lighter, and more agile. She can't overpower larger dinosaurs but she outruns them. Use her for cavalry charges, pursuit, and rapid strikes where speed matters more than raw power.",

A wingspan of forty feet, a beak the size of a man, and the ability to launch from a standing start and climb to altitudes that make her invisible from the ground. She's the bomber of the dinosaur age \u2014 she dives from above and strikes with a beak that impales.",
      "notes": "The quetzalcoatlus is your heavy aerial mount. She's the only dinosaur flyer large enough to carry a fully equipped rider and still fight effectively. Her diving attack adds altitude to damage. She's rare, which makes her a prestige mount \u2014 only the leader of the tribe rides one.",
