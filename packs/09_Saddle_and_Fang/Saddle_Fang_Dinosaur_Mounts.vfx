      "name": "Tyrannosaurus Rex",
      "desc": "Forty feet of apex predator with jaws that crush bone and a roar that freezes prey where they stand. She's not a mount in any practical sense \u2014 she's a weapon system that tolerates a howdah bolted to her back because the handlers keep her fed.",
      "notes": "The T-Rex is your dinosaur boss mount. She's Gargantuan, she causes Fear, and her bite attack is devastating. She's nearly uncontrollable \u2014 Riding checks are required every round in combat. Use her for the chieftain's mount in a lost-world campaign.",

      "desc": "Three horns, a shield of solid bone, and the temperament of a very large, very angry bull. She charges anything that threatens her or her herd, and her impact hits with the force of a small vehicle. She's herbivorous and territorial, which makes her surprisingly good as a war mount.",
      "notes": "The triceratops is your heavy cavalry dinosaur. Her charge is devastating and her frill protects the rider from frontal attacks. She's easier to control than the T-Rex \u2014 she's a herd animal, not a predator. Use her for shield-wall charges where the horns break the formation.",

      "notes": "The raptor pack is your swarm mount. The rider directs six coordinated predators that flank, surround, and overwhelm targets. Use Gang Up bonuses for each raptor in melee contact. They're fragile individually but devastating as a pack.",

      "notes": "The pteranodon is your aerial scout mount. She's light and fast but she can't fight effectively \u2014 her beak is for fishing, not combat. Use her for reconnaissance and message-carrying in campaigns where the players need eyes in the sky.",

      "notes": "The ankylosaurus is your defensive mount. Her natural armour gives her Toughness that rivals vehicles, and her tail club does massive damage. She's slow \u2014 painfully slow \u2014 but nearly indestructible. Use her as a mobile fortress for players who prefer defence.",

      "notes": "The stegosaurus is your tail-weapon mount. The thagomizer does incredible damage to anything behind her. The rider sits between the dorsal plates, which provide Cover. She's too stupid to train for complex manoeuvres \u2014 she has two modes: graze and kill.",
