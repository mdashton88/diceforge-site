## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Mount Starter** provides 10 mounts as basic stat blocks — warhorse, giant eagle, griffin, young dragon, dire wolf, wyvern, war elephant, giant spider, triceratops, and pegasus. These define the vehicle's chassis (size, speed, toughness) without natural weapons or creature-specific abilities.

The **Saddle & Fang supplement** adds mount temperament (will it bolt? will it fight?), natural weapon systems (bite, claw, breath, gore, tail), living vehicle hit points (wounds heal, but slowly), panic and stampede rules, rider bonding mechanics, and howdah/platform systems. The deep packs then deliver fully realised creatures with all systems active.

## .vfx Gaps

**Mount .vfx:** Mount temperament framework, natural weapon system (bite, claw, gore, tail, constrict), breath weapon (fire, ice, acid, lightning), living vehicle HP and healing, panic/stampede rules, rider bonding, barding/armour, howdah platform, wall-climbing (spider), flight rules for living flyers, pack tactics (wolves, raptors), venom (wyvern)

This is the deepest .vfx development in the entire catalogue. Living vehicles are mechanically distinct from everything else in the Forge.

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Mount Starter: "The Griffin Eyrie"
**Inspired by:** The classic fantasy scenario — acquire a rare mount from its natural habitat without dying. Every fantasy world has a "go tame a griffin" quest. Most don't mention the survival rate.

**Setup:** A mountain eyrie holds three griffin chicks. The local lord wants one for his aerial cavalry. The heroes must climb the eyrie, claim a chick, and escape before the adults return. They have warhorses for the approach and a single tamed pegasus for aerial scouting.

**Complications:** The eyrie is higher than reported. The pegasus refuses to approach — it can smell the griffins. A giant eagle nests on the adjacent peak and treats the griffins as rivals, attacking anything near both nests. One griffin chick has already bonded with a wild dire wolf that guards it. The adults return early. They are not pleased.

**Vehicles Used:** Warhorse ×3, Pegasus, Griffin (adult, hostile) ×2, Giant Eagle (territorial), Dire Wolf (bonded guardian)

**Variant — "The Elephant March":** A war elephant column must cross a mountain pass before winter. The elephants are loaded with siege supplies. The pass is contested by wyvern-riders who want to claim the supplies. The elephants can't fight back. The escort can.

### Dinosaur Mounts: "The Lost Valley"
**Inspired by:** Every lost world story — Conan Doyle's, Burroughs', and a hundred imitators. A hidden valley where prehistoric life endures and the food chain hasn't heard of civilisation.

**Setup:** The heroes enter a volcanic valley seeking a lost expedition. Their mounts are parasaurolophus (fast, alert herbivores). The valley contains a tyrannosaurus rex territory, a triceratops herd that blocks the only canyon passage, and a nesting colony of pteranodons on the cliffs above.

**Complications:** The parasaurolophus mounts detect the tyrannosaurus before the heroes do — and bolt. A velociraptor pack shadows the party, waiting for weakness. The lost expedition is alive — they've domesticated an ankylosaurus and aren't interested in leaving. The volcanic tremors are getting stronger. A quetzalcoatlus dive-bombs anything crossing open ground.

**Vehicles Used:** Parasaurolophus ×4, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Triceratops, Pteranodon ×3, Velociraptor Pack, Ankylosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus

**Variant — "The Stampede":** A carnotaurus drives a brontosaurus herd toward a settlement. The heroes must redirect the stampede using raptors, fire, and terrain. The carnotaurus is the real threat, but it won't show itself until the herd is committed.
