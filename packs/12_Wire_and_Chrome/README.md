## Starter → Supplement Upgrade Path

The **Cyberpunk Starter** provides 10 near-future vehicles with modern firearms — corp AV, street racer, tactical drone, merc APC, spider tank, courier bike, armoured riot van, hover limo, cargo drone, and security sedan.

The **Wire & Chrome supplement** adds vehicle hacking frameworks (netrunners can seize control mid-combat), drone operations (swarm tactics, autonomous targeting, electronic countermeasures), corporate escalation mechanics (the response gets worse the longer the fight continues), and ECM/ECCM warfare. The Cyberpunk Fleet pack delivers vehicles designed for those systems — hacker vans, networked drone swarms, and vehicles with both physical and digital attack surfaces.

## .vfx Gaps

**Cyberpunk .vfx:** Vehicle hacking framework, drone operations (swarm control, autonomous mode, networked targeting), ECM/ECCM warfare, corporate escalation table, autopilot mod, mobile hacking rig, neural interface, counter-intrusion systems

## One-Sheet Adventures

### Cyberpunk Starter: "The Corporate Extraction"
**Inspired by:** The universal cyberpunk premise — extract a valuable asset from a corporate arcology while the security response escalates from polite to lethal. Neon, chrome, and moral compromises at 200kph.

**Setup:** The heroes must extract a defecting scientist from a corporate campus. They have a street racer (getaway), a merc APC (heavy support), a courier bike (scout), and a tactical drone (overwatch). The campus security has armoured riot vans, a spider tank on the main gate, and a corp AV on the roof helipad.

**Complications:** The scientist won't leave without their research data — which is on a server inside the campus. The spider tank activates when the perimeter is breached. Corporate escalation: first riot vans, then the AV, then a second AV from regional HQ with a security sedan convoy. The hover limo parked in the executive lot belongs to the CEO — who is also defecting, but to a different faction. The courier bike's neural interface picks up a corporate kill order broadcast on an encrypted channel.

**Vehicles Used:** Street Racer, Merc APC, Courier Bike, Tactical Drone, Spider Tank, Armoured Riot Van ×2, Corp AV, Hover Limo, Security Sedan

**Variant — "The Street Race":** Illegal street race through a neon district. Corporate sponsors. Rigged results. A cargo drone drops spike strips at predetermined points. The real prize isn't the money — it's the data chip hidden in the trophy. Three factions want it. Two of them have spider tanks.
