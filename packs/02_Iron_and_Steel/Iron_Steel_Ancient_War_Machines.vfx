      "notes": "Egyptian chariots are ranged platforms, not melee weapons. The driver handles the horses while the bowman fires \u2014 two characters per chariot, perfect for player pairs. Speed lets them dictate engagement range. Stay outside spear reach and keep shooting.",

      "notes": "The shieldman provides Cover to the bowman, which changes the tactical calculus. Egyptian chariots rely on speed; Hittite chariots rely on durability. Open desert favours Egypt's speed, broken ground favours Hittite resilience. A battle between the two plays very differently depending on terrain.",

      "notes": "The siege tower is a Dramatic Task. Getting her across the killing ground requires multiple rounds of pushing while defenders rain arrows and boiling liquids. Each round, call for Strength rolls from the pushers and Vigor rolls to resist attacks. If she reaches the wall, the assault begins. If she burns, everyone inside is dead.",

The dramatic question is whether the crew survives long enough to break through. Use the gatehouse defenders as active opposition \u2014 boiling oil, dropped stones, and sally attacks from side gates.",

      "notes": "The elephant's weakness is morale. Roll Spirit when she takes a Wound \u2014 on a failure she panics and stampedes, trampling anyone in her path regardless of allegiance. This makes elephants a gamble: devastating when they work, catastrophic when they don't. The players should see both outcomes.",

      "notes": "The helepolis is your Gargantuan set-piece. She's too big to fight conventionally \u2014 the players need to sabotage her, burn her, undermine the ground beneath her, or find some other creative solution. A straight assault against something this size is suicide. She should feel like a boss encounter for engineers rather than warriors.",

The trireme fights by ramming \u2014 she accelerates to combat speed, strikes the enemy hull at the waterline, backs away, and watches her opponent sink.",
      "notes": "The ram is the primary weapon. Ramming uses standard vehicle collision rules, but the bronze ram adds AP. The tactical game is positioning \u2014 hit the enemy amidships while presenting only your reinforced bow. Boarding is a backup plan for when the ram misses.

      "notes": "The quinquereme is the boarding vessel. She doesn't need to outmanoeuvre the enemy \u2014 she just needs to get alongside and drop the boarding bridge. Roman naval tactics deliberately turned sea battles into land battles, and the quinquereme is the tool that makes that possible.",

      "notes": "The scorpion cart is your ancient sniper platform. Heavy bolts punch through shields and light fortifications. Use her to suppress defenders during an assault, pick off enemy leaders, or provide overwatch for a river crossing. She's fragile but her range advantage is significant.",

She fights with fire rather than the ram, and the psychological impact of a ship that sprays liquid flame is worth more than any weapon system.",
      "notes": "Greek fire is the defining weapon. The siphon uses the Cone Template and ignores Waterborne protection. Wooden ships burn beautifully. Use her to demonstrate how naval warfare evolves across eras: from ramming to burning to broadside gunnery. The transition from trireme to dromon tells that story.",
