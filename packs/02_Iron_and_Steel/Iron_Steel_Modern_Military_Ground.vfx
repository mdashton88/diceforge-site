Depleted uranium composite armour, a 120mm smoothbore that fires programmable ammunition, thermal sights that see through smoke and darkness, and a gas turbine engine that sounds like a jet taking off. She has never been destroyed by enemy tank fire in combat.",
      "notes": "The Abrams SEP is the benchmark modern MBT. Advanced AT makes her nearly invulnerable to anything short of the heaviest anti-tank weapons. Her thermal sights remove darkness as a factor entirely. Use her as the ultimate ground threat \u2014 or the ultimate asset if the players can call one in.",
