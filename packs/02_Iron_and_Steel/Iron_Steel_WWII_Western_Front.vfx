      "desc": "The 'Easy Eight' \u2014 the final combat variant of the Sherman with a high-velocity 76mm gun and horizontal volute suspension that smoothed the ride enough to shoot on the move. She's still outgunned by a Tiger, but she can now hurt a Panther frontally, which her predecessors couldn't.",
      "notes": "The E8 is the improved Sherman for late-war scenarios. Her 76mm gun solves the 'can't penetrate' problem of earlier variants. She's still best used with infantry support and numerical advantage rather than in stand-up duels with German heavies. Use her as the player vehicle for 1944-45 campaigns.",

      "notes": "The Tiger is your named threat. She should have a reputation before the players ever see her. Local intelligence mentions a Tiger operating in the area and suddenly every engagement feels more dangerous. Her 88mm kills anything at any range, but she's slow and drinks fuel.

She's fast, she hits hard, and her frontal armour defeats everything short of a 90mm. Her reliability is another matter entirely.",
      "notes": "The Panther is the 'better than a Tiger' surprise for players who think they know WWII tanks. She's faster, her gun is nearly as deadly, and she's more common. Mechanical reliability is her weakness \u2014 transmission failures were epidemic. Roll for breakdown after sustained high-speed movement.",

She's the default 'how do the players get there' answer for any WWII Western Front scenario. Small enough to hide, fast enough to run.",

Use her as the tank the players actually encounter, saving Tigers and Panthers for set-piece engagements. Sch\u00fcrzen armour skirts give her a bonus against shaped-charge weapons.",

      "notes": "The M10 is your ambush predator. She hits hard but the open turret means the crew is vulnerable to artillery, mortars, and infantry.

      "notes": "The StuG is your low-profile ambush vehicle. No turret means she can't traverse \u2014 she has to turn the entire hull to aim. That's a critical weakness in a meeting engagement but irrelevant in a prepared ambush. Use her hull-down behind a hedgerow and she's devastating. Caught in the open, she's vulnerable to flanking.",

      "notes": "The Cromwell is your British equivalent of the Whippet philosophy \u2014 speed over armour. She's fast enough to exploit breakthroughs and scout enemy positions, but she can't slug it out with Panthers or Tigers.
