## One-Sheet Adventures

### WWI — Iron Harvest: "First Contact at Flers"
**Inspired by:** The first tank attack in history — Flers-Courcelette, 15 September 1916. Mark I tanks crawled across no man's land for the first time. Most broke down. The ones that arrived changed everything.

**Setup:** The heroes crew three Mark I tanks (two Male, one Female) tasked with breaking through a German trench line at dawn. Infantry follows behind. The objective is a fortified farmhouse 800 yards across no man's land.

**Complications:** One tank throws a track in the first shell crater. The Female's machine guns jam crossing the wire. German artillery zeros in on the surviving tanks. A lone A7V appears from behind the farmhouse — the first tank-on-tank engagement in history.

**Vehicles Used:** Mark I (Male) ×2, Mark I (Female), A7V Sturmpanzerwagen, Rolls-Royce Armoured Car (reinforcement)

**Variant — "The Whippet Breakout":** Late war. Three Whippets must exploit a gap in the German line and raid a supply depot before the breach is sealed. Speed against time, not firepower against fortification.

### WWII — Western Front: "The Bocage Ambush"
**Inspired by:** The Normandy hedgerow fighting — July 1944. Every field bordered by ancient hedgerows became a kill zone. Panthers and Tigers lurked behind walls of earth while Shermans tried to push through gaps one at a time.

**Setup:** A platoon of three Shermans and a Jeep must push through two miles of bocage to relieve a cut-off paratroop company. Intelligence says light resistance. Intelligence is wrong.

**Complications:** A camouflaged StuG III blocks the main lane. Hedgerow-cutters haven't arrived — the tanks must find gaps or make them. A Tiger I is reported two fields east, but nobody's confirmed it. The paratroopers' radio goes silent.

**Vehicles Used:** M4A3E8 Sherman ×3, Willys MB Jeep, StuG III, Tiger I, Panther (optional escalation)

**Variant — "The Bridge at Dawn":** The platoon must seize a river bridge before retreating Germans demolish it. A Cromwell replaces the Shermans — speed over armour. The bridge is wired. The demolition team has a Panzer IV covering them.

### WWII — Eastern Front: "Stalingrad Alley"
**Inspired by:** The urban fighting in Stalingrad — autumn 1942. Tanks became trapped in streets too narrow to traverse their turrets. Infantry climbed onto them with Molotov cocktails. Every factory was a fortress.

**Setup:** Two T-34/76 tanks and a BA-64 armoured car must push down a ruined boulevard to link up with a factory garrison. Rubble blocks the main road. Side streets are mined. Snipers cover every approach.

**Complications:** A KV-1 is stuck in rubble ahead — its crew is alive but can't move. A Panzer IV Ausf J appears from a side street at point-blank range. The factory garrison fires a flare — they're being overrun. A BM-13 Katyusha battery offers fire support, but the target is dangerously close to friendly positions.

**Vehicles Used:** T-34/76, KV-1, BA-64, Panzer IV Ausf J, BM-13 Katyusha

**Variant — "The River Crossing":** Spring 1944. Soviet forces must cross a river under fire using a makeshift ferry. A River Patrol Boat provides fire support while Lend-Lease Stuarts rush the opposite bank.

---

### Cold War Arsenal: "Checkpoint Bravo"
**Inspired by:** The Fulda Gap scenario — the Cold War nightmare of Soviet armour pouring through West Germany. NATO's plan was to delay long enough for reinforcements. Nobody expected to survive the first 48 hours.

**Setup:** A NATO force (one Centurion, one M48 Patton, two M113 APCs) holds a checkpoint on a valley road. Intelligence reports a Soviet armoured column approaching — at least a T-55 platoon with BMP-1 escorts and a BTR-60 command vehicle. Hold for six hours until reinforcements arrive.

**Complications:** The bridge behind the checkpoint is the retreat route — if it's destroyed, there's no falling back. One M113 throws a track. A flanking force of Ferret Scout Cars reports a second column on a parallel road. Air support is "unavailable." After four hours, a T-72 appears at the head of the column. The Centurion's commander recognises it — that's not a T-55.

**Vehicles Used:** Centurion, M48 Patton, M113 ×2, T-55, BMP-1, BTR-60, Ferret Scout Car, T-72 (escalation)

**Variant — "The Land Rover Dash":** A military Land Rover carrying intelligence documents must reach a NATO airfield before Soviet airborne troops seize it. Pursuit through backroads. Every checkpoint might be friendly or compromised.

### Modern Military Ground: "Sandstorm Overwatch"
**Inspired by:** Modern combined arms warfare — the kind of engagement where thermal optics, ATGMs, and drone surveillance make a handful of vehicles devastatingly effective. Desert Storm, the advance on Baghdad, the battle for Mosul.

**Setup:** A coalition force (one M1A2 Abrams, one M2A3 Bradley, one Stryker ICV) must secure a highway intersection before a mechanised column reaches it. An MQ-9 Reaper provides overwatch. The intersection is defended by a dug-in T-90M and two BMP-3s with infantry support.

**Complications:** The Reaper spots a second force approaching from the south — Warrior IFVs from a coalition ally, or hostile technicals in stolen vehicles? A sandstorm reduces visibility to 200 metres, negating the thermal advantage. The T-90M's active protection system defeats the first ATGM. An MRAP Cougar carrying journalists rolls into the engagement area.

**Vehicles Used:** M1A2 Abrams SEP, M2A3 Bradley, Stryker ICV, MQ-9 Reaper, T-90M Proryv, BMP-3, MRAP Cougar

**Variant — "Urban Clearance":** A Leopard 2A7 and Challenger 2 provide overwatch while infantry clear a city block. A BMP-3 ambush from an underground car park changes everything.

### Ancient War Machines: "The Walls of Kadesh"
**Inspired by:** The Battle of Kadesh (1274 BC) — the largest chariot battle in history. Ramesses II's Egyptian force clashed with Muwatalli's Hittite army. Both sides claimed victory. Neither was lying.

**Setup:** An Egyptian chariot force (three Egyptian Chariots, one Scorpion Cart) must hold a river crossing against a Hittite assault. Two Hittite Heavy Chariots lead the attack, supported by infantry and a war elephant from an allied kingdom.

**Complications:** The river ford shifts — what was knee-deep is now chest-deep. The war elephant panics from the Scorpion Cart's bolts and stampedes through both lines. A dust cloud from the south — Egyptian reinforcements or a Hittite flanking force? The Scorpion Cart's axle cracks.

**Vehicles Used:** Egyptian Chariot ×3, Hittite Heavy Chariot ×2, Scorpion Cart, War Elephant

**Variant — "The Siege of Syracuse":** Naval assault. Three triremes and a quinquereme attempt to breach Syracuse's harbour chain while defensive ballistae and a dromon with Greek fire hold the approaches.

---

### Medieval Siege: "The Siege of Montfort"
**Inspired by:** The great sieges of the medieval period — Château Gaillard, Constantinople, Orléans. The slow, grinding mathematics of trebuchets versus walls, with sortie and counter-sortie breaking the monotony.

**Setup:** The heroes command a siege force (one trebuchet, one mangonel, one siege tower, one battering ram) assaulting a hilltop castle. The garrison has two tower carts, a springald, and a supply of boiling oil.

**Complications:** Rain weakens the siege tower's wheels — it bogs in the mud. A sortie from a hidden postern gate targets the trebuchet. The mangonel's first stone overshoots and hits a war wagon full of the attackers' own supplies. A relief force of cavalry appears on the horizon. The wall cracks — but the breach is too narrow for the battering ram.

**Vehicles Used:** Trebuchet, Mangonel, Siege Tower (Medieval), Battering Ram (Medieval), War Wagon, Springald, Tower Cart

**Variant — "The Hussite Square":** Open field. War wagons form a defensive laager against a cavalry charge. The bombard is loaded. The cavalry is coming. The question is whether the wagons close the gap in time.
