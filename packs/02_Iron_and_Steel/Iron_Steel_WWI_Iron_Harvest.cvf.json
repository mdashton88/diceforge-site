      "desc": "The first tank to see combat, lumbering across no man's land at Flers-Courcelette in September 1916. Two 6-pounder naval guns in sponson mounts give it genuine anti-fortification punch, but the crew of eight work in a deafening, fume-choked steel coffin that regularly exceeds 50 degrees inside.",
      "notes": "Crew morale is the real enemy. Vigour rolls against Heat every 30 minutes of operation or suffer Fatigue. The shock value against troops who've never seen a tank is enormous \u2014 enemies must make Spirit rolls or break. First contact scenarios are pure gold.",

Still murderously slow, still a crew of eight, still an oven on tracks.",

Small, cheap, and produced in their thousands, the FT-17 gave commanders something the heavy tanks couldn't: mass. Two-man crew means it's intimate, cramped, and utterly dependent on the commander doing everything except drive.",
