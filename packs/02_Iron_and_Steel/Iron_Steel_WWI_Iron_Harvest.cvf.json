      "desc": "The first tank to see combat. She rolled across no man's land at Flers-Courcelette in September 1916 and nothing in the German arsenal could stop her. Rhomboidal tracks, sponson-mounted naval guns, and a crew of eight who could barely hear each other over the engine. She terrified everyone \u2014 including the men inside her.",
      "notes": "The Male variant carries two 6-pounder guns in the sponsons \u2014 anti-fortification weapons that crack bunkers and strongpoints. She's painfully slow and mechanically unreliable. Roll Vigor for the crew each hour of operation \u2014 the heat, fumes, and noise inside are genuinely debilitating. Breakdowns should be frequent and dramatic.",

In practice she was just as terrifying \u2014 a steel monster pouring automatic fire into positions that had been impregnable for two years.",
      "notes": "The Female is your anti-infantry variant. She lacks the punch to crack bunkers but her machine guns suppress everything in the open. Use both variants together as they were historically deployed \u2014 Males break the strongpoints, Females clear the trenches behind them.",

      "notes": "The Mark IV is the Mark I that actually works. Better armour stops the German K-bullet that could penetrate the Mark I's sides.

      "notes": "The FT is small, cheap, and deployed in swarms. Individually she's fragile and undergunned, but thirty of them advancing together overwhelm any defence.
