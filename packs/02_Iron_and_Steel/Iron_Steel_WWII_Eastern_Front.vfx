      "desc": "The tank that saved the Soviet Union. Sloped armour that bounced shells the German 37mm couldn't penetrate, wide tracks that floated over mud and snow, and a 76mm gun that killed anything the Wehrmacht fielded in 1941. She was crude, cramped, and produced in numbers that defied belief.",
      "notes": "The T-34 is the Eastern Front's defining vehicle. She's individually outmatched by late-war German armour but she never fights alone. Use her in waves \u2014 the first T-34 the players destroy is a relief, the fifth is routine, the fifteenth is a nightmare. Numbers are the Soviet doctrine and the T-34 is the instrument.",

      "notes": "The KV-1 is your 'nothing we have can hurt it' scenario for early-war campaigns. German 37mm and 50mm guns literally bounce off her. The players need to find 88mm flak guns, call Stukas, or manoeuvre behind her to hit thinner rear armour. By 1943 she's obsolete \u2014 use that transition to show how fast the arms race moved.",

      "notes": "The IS-2 is the Soviet answer to the Tiger. Her 122mm gun kills anything, but the separate-loading ammunition means a slow rate of fire \u2014 one round every twenty seconds compared to the Tiger's six. Use that reload time as dramatic tension. The IS-2 fires, the crew scrambles to reload, and the return fire is already incoming.",

      "notes": "The BA-64 is your scout vehicle. She's fast and expendable. Use her as the first contact in an encounter \u2014 a BA-64 spots the players and radios back before heavier units arrive. She can't fight anything armoured, so if the players are in tanks she's running, not shooting.",

The hand-cranked turret is mechanically significant \u2014 she traverses slower than earlier models, which means a flanking T-34 can get around her before she can aim.
