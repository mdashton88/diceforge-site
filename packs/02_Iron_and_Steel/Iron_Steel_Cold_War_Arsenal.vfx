      "notes": "The Patton is your baseline Cold War NATO tank. She's outgunned by the T-72 but better crewed and better maintained. Use her for proxy war scenarios \u2014 Korea, Vietnam, the Arab-Israeli wars \u2014 where Cold War equipment meets real combat for the first time.",

If the players are fighting someone with Soviet equipment, they're fighting T-55s. Her ammunition is stored in the hull floor, which means a penetrating hit often triggers a catastrophic cook-off.",

Her 20-pounder gun was replaced by a 105mm that became the NATO standard.",

The Israeli 'Sho't' variant with the L7 105mm gun is one of the most combat-proven tanks ever fielded. Use her for any Cold War proxy war where the players need a reliable, well-armed tank that isn't cutting-edge.",

Her twin-engine layout means an engine fire doesn't necessarily stop her \u2014 she can limp home on one. But if both catch fire, the infantry dismount very quickly indeed. Use her in motor rifle scenarios where speed matters more than protection.",

Her aluminium hull is a double-edged sword \u2014 light enough to be airdropped but thin enough that RPGs go straight through. In Vietnam she was called the 'battle taxi.' Use her as exactly that.",

She's slow, uncomfortable, and indestructible.",
