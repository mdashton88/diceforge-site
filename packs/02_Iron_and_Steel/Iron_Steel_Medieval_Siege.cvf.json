      "name": "Trebuchet",
      "desc": "The king of siege weapons. A counterweight engine that can hurl a three-hundred-pound stone over a thousand feet. She takes days to build, requires a team of engineers to calibrate, and can reduce a castle wall to rubble in a week of steady bombardment. She is not a precision weapon. She doesn't need to be.",
      "notes": "The trebuchet fires once per round and misses more often than it hits. But when it hits, it hits like the fist of God. Each stone does massive damage to fortifications. Use Suppression rules for defenders near the impact zone \u2014 the psychological effect is ruinous.",

      "name": "Mangonel",
      "desc": "Smaller and faster than the trebuchet, the mangonel uses torsion \u2014 twisted ropes of sinew or horsehair \u2014 to launch stones on a flatter trajectory. She's less powerful but more accurate, and a competent engineer can build one in the field from available materials in a couple of days.",
      "notes": "The mangonel is your field artillery. Mobile enough to deploy during a battle rather than requiring a week-long siege setup. Use her against formations, gates, and light fortifications. She's also the defender's weapon of choice \u2014 a mangonel on the wall can shatter siege towers and scatter assault columns.",

      "desc": "Taller than the ancient version, often fitted with a drawbridge at the top that drops onto the battlements, and sometimes carrying a battering ram at ground level. She's a combined-arms weapon: ram the gate, assault the wall, and keep the defenders busy on two fronts.",
      "notes": "The drawbridge mechanism makes the assault faster \u2014 defenders have seconds to react when the bridge drops, not the minutes they'd have against scaling ladders. Run the approach as a Dramatic Task, then the drawbridge drop as the dramatic moment that triggers the melee.",

She's an anti-personnel weapon \u2014 the bolt punches through shields, armour, and anyone standing behind them. Defenders mount springalds on towers to sweep the approaches; attackers use them to suppress the walls.",
      "notes": "The springald is your precision weapon. She doesn't do area damage like the trebuchet \u2014 she kills one person very effectively. Use her to create sniper alley zones where the players cross open ground under aimed fire. The springald operator is a named NPC with a good Shooting die.",

      "notes": "Better protected than the ancient version. The defenders know exactly what she's for and concentrate everything on stopping her. Run the approach as a gauntlet of fire, boiling oil, and sally attacks. The question is always whether the crew survives long enough to break through.",

      "notes": "The war wagon is a mobile fortification, not a vehicle in the traditional sense. Once stopped and deployed, she provides Heavy Cover to everyone inside. A circle of war wagons is the medieval tank laager \u2014 cavalry charges break against it. Use it to turn any open field into a defensive last stand.",

She's inaccurate, slow to load, prone to exploding, and the most terrifying sound on the medieval battlefield. The bombard doesn't just break walls \u2014 it announces that the age of castles is ending.",
      "notes": "Enormous damage but fires once every three rounds due to loading time. There's also a chance of catastrophic failure on a Critical Failure \u2014 the bombard explodes, killing the crew. Every shot is tense: fire, wait, reload, pray the barrel holds.",

Not a vehicle in any meaningful sense, but when twenty of them advance together in a line they're a mobile wall of wood that turns an open approach into a covered one.",
      "notes": "Mantlets provide Cover without requiring existing terrain. Each mantlet-bearer moves at half Pace and provides Medium Cover to the archer behind them. The defenders target the mantlets directly, trying to splinter them before the attackers reach effective range.",

      "notes": "The tower cart provides the height advantage that normally belongs to the defenders. Use it to suppress a section of wall before the siege towers arrive \u2014 the archers keep heads down while the real assault develops on either side.",

      "notes": "The supply train is your escort mission. The enemy knows that destroying the supplies ends the siege faster than any sortie. The players protect the train through ambush country \u2014 forests, river crossings, and mountain passes. A well-planned ambush against a supply train is a classic adventure scenario.",
