## Formula (v4.0)
```
Base Toughness = ceil((5 + Size + locoMod) × frameMult)
Total Toughness = Base + Armour

frameMult: civilian = 1.0, rugged = 1.25, military = 1.5
locoMod:   ground/hover = 0, air = -1, water = -2
```

## Notes
- v4.0 used the original weight class system (Roman numerals I-VII)
- v5.x introduced the Threat Grade system (A-F letters) and recalibrated
  the Toughness formula against SWADE canon vehicles
- All twelve supplements and the Companion Guide were written for the v4.0 formula
- The .vfx preset files are JSON format with a .vfx extension
